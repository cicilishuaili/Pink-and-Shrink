Those precious moments of pampering and soaking in warm water is our sweet reward for carrying us around all day. At some point, we've all experienced foot pain. Whether from long days in closed-toe shoes or a night out dancing in heels, our feet yell at us with our discomfort. Each foot is designed with 26 bones, 33 joints, more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments--that's a lot happening in such compact space! Let's help these poor soles out. While many foot ailments can be genetic, many are caused from a lack of attention to our design.

Spread love to your feet by spreading your five toes with us.

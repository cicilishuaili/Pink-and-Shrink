USE THE SOCKS FOR    Keeping your feet dry, warm and comfortable during hiking, trekking, long walks or if you just need a nice pair of everyday socks.    FIT & DESIGN    Merino wool keeps your feet cozy in the winter and fresh and cool in the summer. The exclusive performance blend wick away sweat and then evaporate it fast, so your feet will stay comfortably dry. The targeted ventilation zones allow a constant airflow and being padded from heel to toe, the socks absorb jarring shock and minimize chafing.    TESTED & RECOMMENDED    By Former Navy SEAL Erik B.

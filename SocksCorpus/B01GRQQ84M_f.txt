Balega socks are engineered with the company’s proprietary DryNamix moisture management technology that keeps feet cool and dry while allowing free airflow for maximum comfort, performance and durability. Hand crafted, high performance Ultralight No Show running socks are lighter and thinner to provide a true minimalist running feel. All of Balega’s running socks have been race tested and incorporate a hand linked seamless toe, eliminating abrasion across the top of the foot. The company also knits an extra deep heel pocket ensuring that each sock fits the foot perfectly and does not slide down during a run. Designed with a medium volume construction.

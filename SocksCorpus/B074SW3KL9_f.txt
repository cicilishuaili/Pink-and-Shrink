Feetures Elite Max Cushion is the perfect blend of performance and comfort. Created for athletes who prefer a technically advanced sock with extra cushioning. Elite Max Cushion is designed to cushion every step.  Sizing Instructions - Our socks are unisex and fit according to shoe size. If you size up your running shoes, we recommend that you go by your casual shoe size. (See images for size chart). Although the Lycra in our products contracts when it is exposed to water and heat in the wash, it has incredible recovery properties so Feetures socks will stretch back to their original size after the wash.  Washing Instructions - Machine wash cold. Hang to dry. No bleach or fabric softeners. For best results, wash socks inside out.

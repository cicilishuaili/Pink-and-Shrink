Why MERIWOOL? Soft & Comfortable. When you think wool, you may think scratchy, but MERIWOOL's Merino Wool clothing line is far from it. We only use superfine 18.5-micron 100% all natural Merino wool responsibly sourced from Australia to ensure your comfort all day long with absolutely no itching! Renewable Resource. Feel good knowing that what you are wearing is beneficial to you and also good for the Earth: Merino sheep shed and regrow new ultra-downy coats every year, making their wool a highly renewable resource. Limitless Layers. Merino sheep have adapted to all kinds of weather including freezing winters and scorching summers. Their wool keeps them warm when it's cold, cool when it's hot, and that inspired us. MERIWOOL's superfine Merino wool clothing can be layered as needed, but won't weigh you down or hold you back. Wicking. When you're out exploring all day, there's nothing more uncomfortable than a sweat-soaked shirt sticking to your skin. Merino wool absorbs sweat from your skin and then releases it to the air in a process called "wicking." Wicking keeps you dry and comfortable, and coupled with its natural anti-bacterial properties, that means it resists odors. Rest assured that MERIWOOL's got your back, even when you're out for days in the wilderness. Machine-Washable On Cold Setting & Tumble Dry On Low Heat With Like Colors. Easy to wash, wrinkle-resistant, quick to dry, and with very little maintenance required, Merino wool is ready whenever you are for your next adventure.

Quality You Can Feel Are you tired of supposedly premium wool socks that tend to fall apart within a year? Do you want the comfort and durability of merino wool on your feet, but you don't want to pay an arm and a leg? Are you new to the world of wool socks and you just want something that will keep you comfortable and odor/sweat free all day? Experience Premium Merino Wool at a Bargain Price with People Socks! We designed these socks to be everyday wear - not too thick, not too thin. We also reinforced the toe and heel so they won't wear out on you as quickly as some wool socks can. Why People Socks? Since we started in 2012, we've been on a mission to make merino wool socks affordable and bring them to you in a sustainable manner. Typically, you'll pay around $18 a pair for high-quality merino wool socks; with us you'll pay a small fraction of that -- around $5-$9, and they're made right here in North Carolina to our exacting standards. The People's Promise It's simple: if your socks become defective in any way within a year of your invoice date, we'll promptly send you replacements. It's our way of ensuring you get your money's worth every time you buy from us. Give The Gift of People Socks It seems like every day we hear from someone who had never tried wool socks before buying from us, and they're totally blown away by the superior comfort, sweat and odor control compared to cotton. So if you know someone who could stand to make the switch, our socks make a wonderful gift. The lucky recipient will be thanking you again and again for setting them straight in the sock world. So scroll back up, choose your size and color, and enjoy merino wool on your feet at a price that can't be beat!

Aoliks no show socks are designed to mold to your feet and provide the most comfort for women and men. Low cut on the top so they are completely invisible in boat shoes, loafers and sneakers making them the perfect casual socks. NOTE: 1. These socks are no show socks, that means "no show" for sports shoes and most of casual shoes, not for boat shoes and very low cut shoes. 2. Socks contain the much more cotton fiber than others,the washing shrinkage won't be avoided, we suggest cold water wash,they will stretch back out as soon as you wear them again.

Darn Tough's Light-Cushion sock is perfect for hikers looking for "a little less" cushioning. You know who you are. With half the wool yarn weight of their cushion socks, the lightweight cushion socks deliver lightweight performance with the perfect amount of cushioning along the base of your foot. True Seamless construction provides a smooth performance fit and assures there's no slipping, no bunching, and no blisters, while 17.2 Micron Merino Wool delivers supreme comfort. Breathable and fast drying, this "all-weather" sock stays cool in the summer and warm in the winter plus it's naturally antimicrobial so it repels bacteria and odor - a great feature when you need to get any extra day (or two) out of your socks. Still made in Vermont. Guaranteed for life.

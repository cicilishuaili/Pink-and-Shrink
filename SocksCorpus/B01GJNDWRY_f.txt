Blister Resist socks combine mohair and Drynamix for the perfect blend between nature and technology, keeping feet cool and dry. Drynamix wicks moisture away from the skin, while mohair has the ability to hold moisture and still keep feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer. All of Balega's running socks have been race tested and incorporate a hand linked seamless toe, eliminating abrasion across the top of the foot. The company also knits an extra deep heel pocket ensuring that each sock fits the foot perfectly and does not slide down during a run. Designed with a medium volume construction. Drynamix Polyester 54%, Wool 35%, Nylon 6%, Neofil 3%, Elastane 2%.

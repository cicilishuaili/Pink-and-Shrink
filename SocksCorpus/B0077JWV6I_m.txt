Who Needs Compression Socks? Not Just Athletes - Everyone! Feet and ankle compression socks help improve circulation from your feet to your heart. Suitable for the anyone - from hiker, biker, rock climber, fisher, runner, walker, even for around the house - who wants superior moisture management, comfort and support. Try the unique toe-to-heel, terry looped padding system that acts as a shock absorber. It is constructed using engineered expansion joints that provide comfort and protection without bulk, wrinkling or sheering. How Compression Socks Work: Compression socks exert a gentle pressure one the legs, reducing the diameter of distended veins, and causing an increase in blood flow throughout the body. Unlike traditional dress or athletic socks, compression socks use stronger elastics to create pressure on the legs, ankles and feet. By compressing the surface veins, arteries and muscles, the circulating blood is forced through narrower circulatory channels. As a result, the arterial pressure is increased, which causes more blood to return to the heart and less blood to pool in the feet. The result is relief to tired, heavy legs. Feel the Difference The ultra thin toe seam construction, superior ventilation, wicking and drying capabilities, provide the protective interface between footwear and foot that prevents friction, blistering and rubbing. No special cleaning instructions necessary - simply turn inside out and machine wash normal!

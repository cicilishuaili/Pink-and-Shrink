Boardroom Socks was established in 2010 by drawing on our family's multi-generational textile expertise. We combine the world's finest yarns and local manufacturers to provide you with a comfortable, durable, high quality, American-made dress sock. Our over the calf wool dress socks are knit from luxurious merino wool, a natural fiber that enables your feet to breathe, providing all day comfort and moisture management. We also design the socks with 3% high strength spandex, which we have found to be the ideal amount to ensure the socks will stay up throughout the day while still remaining comfortable around your leg. This line of dress socks is also knit with a vertical rib, a timeless style that is appropriate for any occasion - Monday's meeting or Saturday's dinner party. Our wool dress socks are available in black, dark brown, midnight navy, grey heather, charcoal and khaki. Knit to fit US shoe sizes 8-12. Made with 67% Merino Wool, 30% Nylon, 3% Spandex. Machine wash warm, tumble dry low. Single pair or three packs.

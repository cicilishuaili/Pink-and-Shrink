The Balega Silver Antimicrobial No-Show Compression-Fit Running Sock for Men and Women provides moisture-management and comfort without sacrificing fit and performance. Silver ions are encapsulated in the proprietary Drynamix yarn blend to promote an antibacterial, hygienic environment, keeping feet clean, dry, and free of odors, mold, and fungi. Constructed to mimic a running shoe, the varying tension of the fibers and knit patterns throughout the athletic sock lock in the heel and provide compressive arch support for grip and quick pick-up, while allowing the toes to move freely. The seamless, hand-linked toe box minimizes friction to prevent blisters and chafing. A high heel tab and extra deep heel pocket ensures that the sock wonâ€™t slip down into the shoe. The Balega Silver Antimicrobial No-Show Compression-Fit Running Sock features medium-volume cushioning, ensuring durability for extended training and endurance events.

Swiftwick ASPIRE is engineered with firm compression and a thin profile for a responsive feel. Firm compression supports every contour of the foot to reduce fatigue during endurance activities. Lightweight Olefin fiber in a minimum cushion design is cool, wicks moisture and dries quickly to keep you performing at your best. A thin channeled upper and mesh footbed design provides ventilation to increase breathability. Swiftwick ASPIRE is available in six cuff heights and a wide color selection.

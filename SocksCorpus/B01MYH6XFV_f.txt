MediPEDS focuses on keeping feet healthy. Our socks are engineered to address diabetes-related symptoms, leg fatigue, swelling and dry skin. They are constructed with yarns and comfort features that help reduce foot irritation and pressure on the legs. In addition, these diabetic extra wide crew socks are constructed with coolmax, a moisture-wicking technology that pulls moisture away from skin and keeps feet dry, which also helps to reduce blisters. They also include lycra spandex fibers that help keep the sock comfortably in place and provides extra stretch and recovery. And, it's extra wide throughout the foot, ankle and leg for non-binding comfort all day long. As a national strategic partner of the American diabetes association, MediPEDS is committed to helping people who suffer from this disease.

Difference inspires our culture, stories and products. We celebrate divergent perspectives that spark original solutions. We live at the intersection of art and science, designing products that perform at the highest level while inspiring the human spirit. We're defining the future of knitwear and have an unbridled passion for perfection. We start with the best, and if that's not good enough, we develop our own proprietary fibers. We are writing the book on quality standardization. Why. Because innovation that doesn't last is just a gimmick. Our founders saw a category that had been ignored, taken for granted, looked over, and dismissed. By creating life into something that had been overlooked, we ignited a movement of art and self-expression that has drawn athletes, performers, and iconic cultural influencers to the brand--a group we call the Punks and Poets. We have turned socks into one of the world's most exciting accessories in less than five years. By underpinning our creative roots with a relentless focus on technical innovation, we've ensured that Stance socks are now found in over 40 countries on the feet of those who dare to be different.

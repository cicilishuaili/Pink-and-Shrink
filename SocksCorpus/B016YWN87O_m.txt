MediPEDS focuses on keeping feet healthy. Our socks are engineered to address diabetes-related symptoms, leg fatigue, swelling, and dry skin. They are constructed with yarns and comfort features that help reduce foot irritation and pressure on the legs. As a national strategic partner of the American diabetes association, MediPEDS is committed to helping people who suffer from this disease.

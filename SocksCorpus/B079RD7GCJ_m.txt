We have turned socks into one of the world's most exciting accessories in less than four years. Our founders saw a category that had been ignored, taken for granted, looked over, and dismissed. By creating life into something that had been overlooked, we ignited a movement of art and self-expression that has drawn athletes, performers, and iconic cultural influences to the brand--a group we call the Punks & Poets. By underpinning our creative roots with a relentless focus on technical innovation, we've ensured that RioRiva socks are now found in over 20 countries on the feet of those who dare to be different.

MediPEDS focuses on keeping feet healthy. Our socks are engineered to address diabetes-related symptoms, leg fatigue, swelling, and dry skin. They are constructed with yarns and comfort features that help reduce foot irritation and pressure on the legs. In addition, diabetic quarter socks feature nanoglide, a special fiber that helps reduce hot spots and blisters caused by friction. They also include lycra spandex that help keep the non-binding top comfortably in place, a seamless toe that eliminates pressure points and soft cushioning that helps to protect feet and provides extra shock absorption in high impact areas of the foot. As a national strategic partner of the American diabetes association, MediPEDS is committed to helping people who suffer from this disease.

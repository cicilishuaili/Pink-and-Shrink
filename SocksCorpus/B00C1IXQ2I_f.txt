Balega socks are engineered with the company’s proprietary DryNamix moisture management technology that keeps feet cool and dry while allowing free airflow for maximum comfort, performance and durability.  All of Balega’s running socks have been race tested and incorporate a hand linked seamless toe, eliminating abrasion across the top of the foot. Unique Triple-Y heel creates a deeper heel pocket, ergonomically formed to the shape of your heel, fits the foot perfectly and does not slide down during a run.

Designed with a 4 DegreeTM elite fit system the run light elite socks compromise two elastics, yielding greater stretch and recovery. Supplemented with a narrow profile contrasting with the menswear line, a perfect women's specific run fit is afforded to the wearer. Patented ReliaWoolTM technology, strategically located in high impact areas increases durability, prolonging the lifespan of the sock. Further benefits include mesh ventilation zones adhering to the contours of the feet, providing breathability. Virtually seamless toe works in conjunction with the achilles tab to enhance comfort. Finished with a 200 needle construction, high-density cushioning is afforded to the wearer without inducing added weight.

Creed celebrates the chivalry and valor of Napoleon, through Aventus. This fragrance was launched in 2010 and has the effects of romance, gallantness and genteel spirited up. The perfect accord of leathery appeal, with the chypre musky effect and the rejuvenating fruitiness make it an enticing choice for the virile. The top notes are a tantalizing citrus splurge of bergamot, black currant, red apple and pineapple. This leads to the floral heart of jasmine, rose with patchouli and birch. The musky base of oak moss and amber is laid on the creamy vanilla base. It is available as eau de toilette.

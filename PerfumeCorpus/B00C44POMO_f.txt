Kate Spade has launched this new fragrance in April 2013. The fragrance is named Live Colorfully. Previous perfumes of the house include Kate Spade from 2003 and Twirl from 2010. Live Colorfully is a fragrance made in-house that marks the 20th anniversary of the brand. She lights up every room she enters. layered with a complex spectrum of bright florals, citrus and musk, the subtle notes of live colorfully playfully shift throughout the day to delight, surprise and serve as a sophisticated (and slightly mischievous) reminder to constantly step into the world of color around of you. the key note of gardenia is at the heart of this uplifting fragrance, but its the unexpected mix of classic olfactive ingredients (vanilla, musk) with few more exotic touches (coconut water, tiare flower) that lend live colorfully its complexity and depth to last all day long. bottled in a rainbow-hued prism thats capped with a shiny lucite stopper (fashioned after our signature detail, a well placed bow) the sparkling, modern floral fragrance embodies kate spade new yorks penchant for bringing a hint of whimsy to the everyday.

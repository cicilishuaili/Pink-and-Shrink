Soft, yet unexpected, Cambridge Knight is your new classic. From the creators of English Laundry fragrances, the sensual blend opens with notes of grapefruit, black currant and musk, slowly unfolding to reveal notes of jasmine, bay leaf and guaiac wood and finally finishing with notes of cedar, oakmoss and patchouli. It will take you on the perfectly effortless journey from morning til night.

Brain-Aid is a combination of feel-good, uplifting and mentally energizing oils, and is a favorite among massage therapists. Feeling "foggy" in the mid afternoon? Take a 2 minute stretch break from what you're doing and sniff a personal aromatherapy inhaler with Brain-Aid synergy inside for a quick "pick-me-up". For children, try our fantastic companion KidSafe synergy blend called A+ Attention. For diffusion, inhalation, massage, body care products. Also can apply to wrists or temples. For topical use, dilute to 2%.

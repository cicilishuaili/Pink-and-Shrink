COOL WATER by Davidoff for Men EDT SPRAY 6.7 OZ lavender, jasmine, oakmoss, musk, sandalwood.When applying any fragrance please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you. For instance, your mood, stress level, age, body chemistry, diet, and current medications may all alter the scents you wear. Similarly, factor such as dry or oily skin can even affect the amount of time a fragrance will last after being applied.  In the top note, the swells of peppermint and lavender burst to the surface. In the heart, the top moves outwards with force and intensity in notes of oakmoss, geranium and sandalwood. In the base note, the heart glides in a warm flow of amber and musk facets.

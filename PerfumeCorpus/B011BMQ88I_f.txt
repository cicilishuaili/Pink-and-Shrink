Rogue Love by Rihanna is a fragrance with freshness and florals that captures the moment when love first hits you. Delicious fruits tempt your senses with notes of succulent peach and juicy berries. At the core, layers of lush, rich florals are splashed with the simply irresistible seduction of coconut. A mysterious femininity emerges as powerful, lingering notes of rich creamy woods and golden amber are drizzled with an addictive hint of caramel.

New fragrance by the house of Roger & Gallet was created in collaboration of two prominent perfumers, Alberto Morillas and Amandine Clerc Marie who transfer three main aspects of ginger with their composition. Top notes are based on original and exciting ginger scent, reminding us of colorful imagery and exotic of the island of Zanzibar. Spicy citrusy shades of ginger are rounded with luminous notes of mandarin with a juicy and optimistic hint of pomegranate. This unique cocktail provides characteristic sensuality and energy to the perfume.Notes of the heart explore the main streets of Zanzibar presented with ginger blossom. Their opulent look, bright red color and exotic, intense and feminine scent is combined with orange blossom and fruity zests of litchi, while accentuating the floral heart of the composition full of love.Base notes introduce sweet, candied ginger combined with woody notes of cedar. A fine, velvety trail lingers behind white musk, softening the composition and making it even more alluring.Fragrance Roger & Gallet Gingembre Rouge arrives in characteristic glass flacon in red color iridescent in shades of strong pink. Gingembre Rouge was launched in 2014. Gingembre Rouge was created by Amandine Marie and Alberto Morillas.

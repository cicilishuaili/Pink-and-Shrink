Composed by Master Perfumer Harry Fremont in 1992, this fragrance is as sexy as the supermodels who strut he catwalk for Victoria's Secret. With a touch of the mysterious Orient and big city glamour, Rapture will make him weak in the knees. Notes include citruses and orange blossom freesia, jasmine and bulgarian rose, amber, musk, vanilla and heliotrope.

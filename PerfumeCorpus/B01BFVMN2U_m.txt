Oros eau de parfum is developed using natural oils and special aromatic ingredients, making the fragrance irresistible and incredibly long lasting. The fragrance opens with very fresh notes of citrus accords paired up with pink pepper and continues to a sensual blend of spices like bay leaves, ginger and cedar, with jasmine adding edge to the fragrance. The base notes, uses a very unique mix of guaiac wood, patchouli and sandalwood making the fragrance long-lasting. As jasmine are night blooming flowers, Oros is developed using the ''Absolute'' technique of extraction, in which a very large amount of flowers are required to produce a small amount of oil. The flowers have to be gathered at night because the odor of these flowers is more powerful after dark. The flowers are laid out on cotton cloth soaked in olive oil for several days and then extracted leaving the true essence.

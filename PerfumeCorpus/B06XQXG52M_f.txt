Sophisticated. Intimate. Romantic. A fragrance of desire. A modern vision inspired by timeless sophistication. A collection of fragrances that evokes the intimacy and emotion of Vera Wang. Modern. Confident. Independent. Vera Wang Embrace Green Tea & Pear Blossom is Fresh Floral. The opening blends Pear Blossom and the earthy crisp quality of Green Tea. The heart blooms of Freesia, Peony, and Orange Blossom, radiating throughout the creation. At the back, fresh comfort is felt in Skin Musk and Sandalwood which wrap the fragrance in eternal love.

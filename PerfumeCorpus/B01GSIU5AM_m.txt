The remedy for that in-between-adventures feeling!  You know that feeling, right?  You're ordinarily out adventuring - camping, using a hatchet for something, gunfighting, lighting an explosive object on fire - but right now, you're sitting on your couch in your robe working on a Amazon product description.  It happens!  But you don't have wallow in that couch-bound-writer smell! You can smell like bourbon, tobacco, and leather, just like a fine gentleman or gentlewoman. This solid cologne comes in a portable tin. Just circle your warm finger on the surface for a little bit, and then apply to pulse points (or wherever you want). Personally, I just rub the surface of the cologne right on my wrists and leave out the middle man. Ingredients: beeswax, grape seed, coco butter, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, rosemary seed, and fragrance oil.

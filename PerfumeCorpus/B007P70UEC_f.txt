Lemongrass is known as being a helpful addition to outdoor sprays. It is refreshing and deodorizing when diffused, as well as being uplifting to the spirit. It can also be added, well-diluted, to a carrier oil to boost circulation, bringing warmth to overused muscles and joints. Lemongrass contains citral, a powerful skin sensitizer, so it is very important to use lemongrass in proper dilution. In proper dilution, it is wonderful for the aches and pains associated with aging. Try 2 drops of lemongrass in two teaspoons (10 ml) of carrier oil along with 2 drops of lavender or sweet marjoram for a soothing muscle rub.

Imagine this: you sit down for a delectable dinner at your favorite restaurant when your stomach starts rumbling. We've all been in that position frantically wishing our stomach pains away. Is there anything worse than giving up the pleasure of a delicious meal to head to the (cough, cough) restroom? With Digest Ease, you may never have to experience those awkward moments of tummy trouble again. Plus, you avoid the chalky taste of many drugstore brands. Its woodsy and spicy aroma promotes natural balance in the digestive system by calming and cleansing. A few drops on the skin of the belly can make a huge difference. Digest Ease is a soothing mixture of Cardamom, Lemon, Ginger, Lavender, Fennel, Carrot Seed, Spearmint, and Vanilla. Made with care from our top quality oils and, as always, Edens Garden essential oils are never diluted or mixed with additives.

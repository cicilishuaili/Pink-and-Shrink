Preferred stock by Coty cologne is a sexy and fresh aromatic fougere fragrance, for men who live life to the fullest and don't stop until their scents do. Preferred stock begins with a refreshing, clean citrus complex laced with lavender and cypress, and then warms up to a masculine heart of notes centered around nutmeg, fir balsam and clary sage. Sensual leather, vetiver, and oak moss make up its base. Launched in 1990.

Shape, spirit, mystery, sensuality this is the concept which inspired the creation of the new box. Strictly black. The color becomes the predominant element. The black cap, the black bottle, the black shoulders, the black actuator. The original design, severe and smooth, of the scuderia Ferrari fragrance bottle, now acquires an irresistible strength and power. Entirely hot sprayed with black matt paint, with a satin finish, the bottle has the same velvety softness as the box, a real pleasure to the touch as well as to the eyes. In the center the beautiful label reigns, resin-bonded in relief in the shape of the shield, a precious and priced detail, a seal which bestows movement and tridimensionality.

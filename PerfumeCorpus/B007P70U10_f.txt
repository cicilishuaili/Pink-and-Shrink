Spicy and heart warming, Clove Bud essential oil is a powerful cleaner for the home, especially during seasonal illness. When diffused, it can be an added tool to support a healthy immune system. Clove bud can be used as part of an autumn or winter holiday blend with sweet orange, cinnamon bark/leaf, and ginger or nutmeg to create a warm, cozy, inviting atmosphere. When highly diluted with your favorite carrier oil, it can be massaged on the outer jaw of adults to help with the occasional toothache; similarly, it can be massaged over aching joints which come with normal wear and tear or aging.

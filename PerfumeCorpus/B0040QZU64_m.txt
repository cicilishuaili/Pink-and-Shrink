Versace Pour Homme for Men Eau De Toilette Spray 6.7 Oz / 200 Ml by Gianni Versace. Versace Pour Homme is another touch of class from the home of Versace that came out in 1986. This superb creation is for men who like intense and tender fragrances. The notes collected and amalgamated are woody, citrusy, spicy, floral and vanillic which leave a definite trail behind them. It is masculine yet silky; strong but tasteful; lavish and model to be worn anytime anywhere

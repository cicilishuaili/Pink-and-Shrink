The earth is rich with natural healing power and there may be no better example of this than Tea Tree. It purifies as it heals and is a must for any home medicine cabinet or first-aid kit. With an aroma that is powerfully clean and camphorous, Tea Tree can work wonders on fungal infections and is an all-natural way to heal the skin. It helps remedy oily skin, dandruff, gingivitis, burns, athlete's foot, and acne with a range of anti-infectious, antiviral, antibacterial properties. Applying it topically with natural ointments, salves and compresses can restore skin tissue when properly diluted. Beyond the skin, Tea Tree can help boost the immune system and refresh the respiratory system. It is also a common therapy for yeast infections and urinary tract infections. Discovered in 1770 by Captain Cook, Tea Tree was first brewed as a tea. The evergreen tree is native to Australia in wet lowland locations and grows about 10 to 25 feet. It has papery white bark, dark-green needle-like leaves and colorful flowers. Tea Tree belongs to a family of about 200 species of evergreen trees. The leaves are steam distilled to extract the clear essential oil.

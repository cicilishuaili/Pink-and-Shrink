Coach Eau de Parfum is inspired by the spontaneous energy and chic downtown style of New York City. A fragrance full of contrasts, opening with bright, sparkling raspberry, giving way to creamy Turkish roses, before drying down to a sensual suede musk base. The feminine oval bottle references many of Coach's iconic codes. Its spray cap is shaped like a gold turnlock, imitating the signature clasp on Coach bags. Ebony and polished metal hangtags add a distinctive finishing touch. A horse and carriage logo, an enduring symbol of Coach craftsmanship, is subtly engraved into the glass. A nod to femininity, the soft pink packaging features a pebble leather effect as a tribute to the original American leather brand.

Plant Therapy's Organic Oregano Essential Oil is 100% pure and natural with absolutely no fillers or additives. While we love oregano oil for its effectiveness, we caution that it must be diluted and applied correctly in order to avoid skin irritation. For topical uses, we recommending a maximum dilution of 1% with a carrier oil. Many essential oil users enjoy the intense, herbaceous scent of oregano, and it is regarded as a powerhouse oil. Used correctly, Organic Oregano Oil can work wonders! As always, you can count on Plant Therapy to use only the highest quality ingredients and processes to produce our oils.

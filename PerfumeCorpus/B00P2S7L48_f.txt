Copaiba Balsam has long been used to soothe the joint pains associated with normal aging. It makes a delicate warming addition to respiratory blends, and is a bit more gentle than stronger oils like eucalyptus. The reasons for using the oleoresin in aromatherapy are that it does less damage to the trees, and it contains more therapeutic compounds than the distilled oil. And unlike most other oleoresins, this one is oil soluble! Add 2 drops Frankincense and 2 drops Copaiba to 1 tablespoon of carrier oil and massage on sore areas of the body. Copaiba can also be to help with occasional digestive upset. Add 2 drops Copaiba essential oil to 1 teaspoon of carrier oil and massage in a clockwise direction on your abdomen to help with digestive issues. 1 drop each of copaiba, black pepper, and coriander added to 1-2 teaspoons of carrier oil or lotion makes a soothing chest rub.

For seasonal illness, add 2-3 of drops of marjoram to 1 ounce of milk or 1 teaspoon carrier oil, then add this to 1/2 cup of Epsom salts in a warm bath to help relieve symptoms. Add marjoram to a carrier oil or lotion to relieve occasional tired, sore muscles such as after a strenuous workout or to relieve the discomfort suffered during the menstrual cycle.

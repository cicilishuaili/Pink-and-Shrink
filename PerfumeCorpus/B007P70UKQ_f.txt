Lavender Organic is similar to its sister, Lavender, but unique because it is certified USDA organic. Every Lavender Organic includes the test reports on the Plant Therapy website to show to the buyer that you are indeed getting USDA certified organic Lavender. Originated in Bulgaria, Lavender Organic or Lavandula Angustifolia, is a full-body lavender that is steam distilled from the flowering tops of the Lavender plant.

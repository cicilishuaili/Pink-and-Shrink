Rosemary is a small perennial shrub that belongs in the mint family. It grows about 1 meter (3.3 feet) in height, but can grow up to 2 meters (6.6 feet). Although it came from the Mediterranean area, Rosemary has naturalized over the centuries and is grown in other parts of the world in warm climates. This small shrub packs a powerful punch when steam distilled from the aerial parts of the plant into an essential oil. The powerful, fresh, woody-herbaceous scent is a powerful aid to boosting memory retention, restore the mind and body after an exhausting day, or when one needs to stay alert. Rosemary is a refreshing addition to skin and hair care products. By adding a few drops of Rosemary to shampoo it can promote a healthy scalp and lustrous locks.

The captivating, complex scent of Oxford Bleu by English Laundry reveals a distinctive bouquet of notes as its layers unfold. While this warm-weather fragrance is grounded in citrus, an evolving set of aromas keeps things interesting. Top notes of mint and lemon turn to mid notes of iris and geranium, before finishing off with a woodsy base of sandalwood and vanilla.

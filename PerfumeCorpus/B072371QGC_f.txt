To provide the top-quality peppermint oil, we have made it sure that we use only the highest quality leaves. Del Mar Naturals Peppermint Essential Oil is not a blend of isolated components, but a pure and natural essential oil from steam distillation. No dilution or adulteration made. The quality of peppermint oil - mentha piperita is determined by the composition of its constituents. It is controlled particularly by leaf age (which affects the proportion of menthol and menthone), and flowering (which affects menthofuran level). Our peppermint oil has about 45% menthol, 33% menthone and isomenthone, 5% cineole, 5% menthyl acetate, and 2% menthofuran. The experience of our authentic peppermint essential oil is like a cool breeze after a sweet spring rain. At first, it's cooling and bracing, then warming and comforting. Pure peppermint oil will refresh your whole being and awaken your senses. It naturally alleviates discomfort and produces a fresh room fragrance with a diffuser or humidifier. SAFETY WARNING: For external use only. Keep out of reach of children and pets. Dilute with a carrier oil such as argan, almond, or coconut oil before applying to skin.

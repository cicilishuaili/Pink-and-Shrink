Thyme Thymol is one of the very best essential oils for supporting the immune system and for tonifying the circulation. It can be used to help resolve skin problems that may be acquired during a hospital stay. Thyme oil can also be useful in support of a clear respiratory tract; diffuse a drop or two during times of seasonal illness. Like many of the herb and spice oils, thyme can be beneficial for occasional digestive upset. Thyme Thymol can help aid normal digestion. During an instance of tummy upset, well-diluted thyme (one drop in one teaspoon of carrier) can be rubbed in a gentle clockwise motion on the abdomen. During times of seasonal illness, thyme can be placed in the diffuser (no more than 3 drops) along with rosalina, spruce, or fir needle to help ease congestion and promote better air quality. If you have been hospitalized, once you are home and have been cleared to shower, consider adding 9 drops per each ounce of liquid body wash to help your skin feel free of "hospital smell".

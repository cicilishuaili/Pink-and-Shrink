More than 5,000 years ago, the Ancient Egyptians burned frankincense in holy temples during religious ceremonies and later used the gum as a facial mask to rejuvenate the skin. Native to the Mediterranean, Frankincense is found in sunny, dry locations. The tree grows to about 20 feet and sprouts glossy leaves and white flowers. When the bark is damaged, a resin pours out of the tree. Through a steam dilution process the essential oil is extracted from the resin.

Ed Hardy Love & Luck for men is described as “a bright, eclectic mix of fruits and fresh scents”. The scent was developed by perfumer Olivier Gillotin (who also developed the original Ed Hardy for men); the notes include bergamot, orange, mandarin, cardamom. It has a heart of absinthe, sage, cypress and violet and a drydown of musk, cedarwood, dark vetiver and agarwood.

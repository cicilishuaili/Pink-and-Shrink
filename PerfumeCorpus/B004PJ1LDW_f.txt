A more concentrated version of the Lolita fragrance. An almost edible fragrance that celebrates the striking enchantment of the liquorice flower. The bottle is a precious rounded object of desire to be kept close at hand, a statement in contemporary baroque with a sensuous feel to it. A golden heart pierced by an arrow evokes naive, tender love, ivy leaves for eternal love and the color mauve for mystery. Anise, ivy, violet and tonka bean come together in a liquorice harmony, and then gently merge with the sweet notes of amarena, vanilla and praline. Then, sensuous notes conjured up from florals, iris roots and musk unfold. A subtle combination of sensations that appeals to all of our senses.

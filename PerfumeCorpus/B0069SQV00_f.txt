In our opinion, there is no better oil than the "sparkle" of Pink Grapefruit to lighten up mental fatigue and moodiness. Pink Grapefruit oil can be used in a 1% dilution as a purifier of congested, oily and blemish prone skin and is sometimes added to carrier oil or creams and lotions as a natural toner. Diffuse several drops of Pink Grapefruit with 2-3 drops Fir Needle or Rosemary to help with occasional tension in the head and neck or apply topically to the abdomen diluted in a carrier oil for digestive upset.

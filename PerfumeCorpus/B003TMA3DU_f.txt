Calming the mind can be an exhaustive exercise. We all have weeks where the days seem so blended and tangled together that unraveling our thoughts feels impossible. When life feels messy, bergamot essential oil can help relieve scattered thoughts while promoting focus and clarity. It is often recommended to restore emotional balance and calm children on the verge of a tantrum or meltdown. Diffusing bergamot with lavender before bedtime can lead to sweet dreams and a restful wake. Native to southeast asia, bergamot is cold pressed then vacuum distilled from an evergreen citrus tree. The fragrant trees also line the ivory coast, morocco, tunisia and algeria. Although the tree bears non-edible green and yellow fruit, the tree peel of the fruit has been used for centuries to reduce fevers and help rid the body of worms. Beyond its medicinal and balancing qualities, bergamot is a wonderfully soothing aroma to layer in perfumes and confections. Mixing a few drops of bergamot into your most-loved carrier oil can be used to nourish your hair and improve its shine.

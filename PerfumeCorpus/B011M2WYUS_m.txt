This fragrance's exhilarating first impression captivates with the unexpected freshness of spicy ginger, coconut water, and star anise. The heart pulsates with notes of crisp star fruit, cedar leaf, and patchouli. A bold masculine signature of exotic Moroccan cedar wood, Tonka bean and Madagascar vanilla linger with vibrant sensuality.

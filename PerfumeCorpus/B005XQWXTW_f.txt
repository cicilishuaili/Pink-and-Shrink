Juniper Berry, famously known as the berry from which the alcoholic spirit gin is obtained, is an essential oil well-known for its calming effects on nervous tension. Diffused into the air, it can be used as a natural purifier and is great to use during meditation. When applied diluted to the skin, juniper berry produces skin warmth which may help ease the discomfort of a strenuous workout. Diluted in carrier oil and rubbed on the legs, it can assist with feelings of congestion or tightness. Add 2 drops of Juniper Berry, two drops of cypress, and 2 drops of Roman chamomile in a carrier oil to apply to areas of soreness after a workout. If you spend long hours on your feet, a refreshing footbath with 1/2 cup Epsom salts, 1 teaspoon carrier oil, 15 drops juniper berry and 15 drops spearmint oils will feel amazing. Mix the essential oils into the carrier oil and stir; add to the Epsom salts and mix thoroughly into the water in the foot basin.

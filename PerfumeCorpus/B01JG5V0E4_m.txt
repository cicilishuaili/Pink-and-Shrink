Dylan Blue is the new fragrance that captivates the sensual scents of the Mediterranean. Woody notes of ambrox evoke tradition, while exquisite citrus- bergamot and grapefruit, give off modernity. Aquatic hints add invigorating freshness. Enveloping notes of black pepper, papyrus wood and incense bestow masculinity, forming the fragrance's pulsating heart. The base is accentuated in a combination of seductive mineral musk, tonka beans, and saffron- recalling a man's individuality.

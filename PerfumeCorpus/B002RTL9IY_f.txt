So skip the chemicals and give lemon a try. Not only does it cleanse the air, surfaces and the body, lemon essential oil can uplift sullen moods and inspire positive thinking. Sourced from the romantic lands of Italy, Edens Garden essential oil is the highest quality available. Lemon trees reach about 20 feet in height and grow serrated leaves, thorns and fragrant flowers.

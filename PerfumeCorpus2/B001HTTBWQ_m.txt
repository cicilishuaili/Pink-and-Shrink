Launched in 2008, this signature scent is perfect for the modern man: knowledgeable and confident, living in harmony with his natural surroundings with a dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit. The Versace Pour Homme man communicates his passionate character with this masculine aroma.Diamante Citrus, Bitter Orange leaves and Neiroli flowers light up the fragrance with Mediterranean accents. The heart of Versace Pour Homme is characterized by the mineral-floral aroma, almost tactile, of Clary Sage and Blue Hyacinth. Amber and Musk deliver deep and sensual base notes, the essence of pure masculinity.

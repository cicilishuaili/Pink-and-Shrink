I start making something but at a certain point it starts making choices by itself. It is the process that interests and guides me. I like the feeling that I'm losing control and I'm not the one making the choices. My involvement is to create something that is alive that will be able to say new things. I want my perfumes to have an intelligence of their own, not just be slave to my meaning. The Nose

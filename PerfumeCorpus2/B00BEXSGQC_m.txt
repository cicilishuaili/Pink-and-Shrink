A fragrance with a vintage vibe and yet representing a modern era charm. A scent which has been Nabeel's best seller over the decades now in body spray/deodorant form. Nabeel Body spray is a perfume product, similar to aerosol deodorant, which is intended to be used elsewhere on the body besides the armpits. Body sprays are lighter in strength than cologne and double as deodorant. How to use: Take the cap off the can. Point the can at the part of your body you wish to spray, and hold it at least six inches away from the surface. You can hold it from farther if you want to spread out the smell. Press down on the button as far as it goes and holds for just a second at a time. Repeating it if necessary. A good strategy for application is a quick spray to each underarm, each wrist. You might also spray some in your hands and lightly pat your arms with it while it's still wet. This is best done with only the lightest scents. Deodorant or antiperspirant can be also used as shoe odor removal or foot spray that you can spray deodorant to fresh your shoes and control your foot odor-free.

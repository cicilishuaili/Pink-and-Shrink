Outremer's signature Eau de Toilette bottles, decorated with intricate Art Nouveau filigree, make an elegant addition to your fragrance collection. The artisanal scents within capture the same vintage-inspired sense of sophistication. The scent of Vanille is not so much a simple, one-note vanilla as it is mouth-watering sugar cookies... or is it fresh-baked cake? A bit of cotton candy? The most feverishly pursued of all Outremer's finely crafted scents, Vanille is sweet and sumptuous, but never overpowering. It will garner endless compliments and keep you coming back for more. Please note: Vanille Eau de Toilette is made in small batches and may have subtle variations in scent or color.

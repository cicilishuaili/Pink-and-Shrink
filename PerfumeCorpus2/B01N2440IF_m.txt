Inspired by ambrosia/mead, the honeyed wine known as the nectar of the gods, perfumer Mathilde Laurent has developed a groundbreaking composition described as oriental-transparent. An eau de parfum of dualities, L'Envol is both strong and mellow with sweet resins set against airy musk. The extraordinary, eye-catching bottle is a capsule contained within a detachable glass dome. The capsule can be carried independently and is refillable. The bottle retains the classic and stylish Cartier tradition with its famous guilloche motif on the bottle stopper while the dome demonstrates Cartier's glasswork expertise.

Ed Hardy Women's EDT is a female fragrant representative of the tattoo art. Its design brings effective pink application in line with the scent. The exciting composition of this fragrance opens with explosive notes of tropical mango, wild strawberries and red grapefruit. The heart introduces mystic black freesia, while the base follows with amber and rose accords.

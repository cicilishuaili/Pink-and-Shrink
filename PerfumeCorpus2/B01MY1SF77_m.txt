Sauvage is inspired by wild, open spaces; blue sky that covers rocky landscapes, hot under the desert sun. The fragrance is announced as radically fresh, raw and noble at the same time. The composition is reportedly prevalent with carefully selected natural ingredients. Fresh top notes of Calabria bergamot encounter ambroxan, obtained from precious ambergris, and its woody trail. Launched in September 2015.

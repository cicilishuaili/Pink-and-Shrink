A true gentleman, he makes an appearance unknowingly and without pretention. His cool, calm and refreshing confidence are evident in his every move. Fresh notes of pineapple and pear are spiced up with cardamom, tarragon leaves and zesty ginger to always keep things interesting. In his heart lies a strength and character that many notice, but few get to really know reflected with assuring woods and a hint of unexpected cinnamon. As his personality unfolds one layer at a time, nuances of sandalwood and oak moss are brushed with a gentle hint of Tonka and wrapped in a masculine skin musk. Be the Evolution.

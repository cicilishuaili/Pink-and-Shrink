Grapefruit and the signature essence of bergamot champagne bring a sparkle to the top of this aromatic note mixed with juniper for an airy freshness. The rich yet subtle scent of black rose combines with the essence of lavender de Provence to create a unique masculine floralcy. An herbal blend of sage, thyme, and tarragon make a robust heart. In the base, rich oak moss and midnight musk blend with sandalwood, glowing amber, and exotic inner woods to create a sexy masculine dry down.

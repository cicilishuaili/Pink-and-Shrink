Terre d' hermes by hermes for men has the history of an alchemic journey through the elements: earth, air and water. A woody, vegetal and mineral fragrance. This is for the man who has his feet firmly on the ground, but his head is in the stars. A creation encapsulating all the earth's elements, like wood,flowers, and stone .Key ingredients of grapefruit and peppers give the fragrance vigour, whilst the earthy aromas of vetiver and cedarwood add richness and aroma.

Cedarwood Atlas has been traditionally used in cedar chests and closets to deter moths. Many of us have a special mother or grandmother that passed down the cedar chest she received as a wedding gift. I just love opening my mom's cedar chest and smelling its wonderful aroma all these years later. Cedarwood Atlas essential oil is clear to yellow in color with a strongly aromatic scent that is both dry and slightly sweet, woody and with hints of both balsamic and spicy. In blends, Cedarwood Atlas is considered to be a middle/base note. Cedarwood Atlas can be used as part of an insect blend along with Citronella, Lemon Eucalyptus, and Catnip essential oils. Cedarwood Atlas can help support healthy respiratory function; diffuse equal amounts of cedar wood and pine oils together to make a soothing aroma which can help with respiratory problems associated with pollen. It can also be mixed with a carrier oil and rubbed on the upper chest to help ease congested breathing. Also, to promote a healthy, flake-free scalp, add a few drops of Cedarwood Atlas to your favorite shampoo. Men especially love Cedarwood Atlas oil because of the crisp, masculine scent it gives to aftershave and other personal care products.

Introducing a Remarkably Calming, Relaxing, Ultra Concentrated Therapeutic Grade Lavender Oil Lavender Oil has been used for centuries to reduce anxiety, alleviate emotional stress, improve sleep and to create a general sense of calm around the home. Some people also find it can help to heal burns and wounds, improve skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis, remedy headaches and even slow the visible signs of aging. However, these incredible benefits can only be achieved if you use real lavender oil, rather than a synthetic substitute. The Truth About Most Lavender Oils On The Market Today Real lavender oil is highly prized, and lavender farms can't keep up with global demand. Sadly this has led some unscrupulous people to create huge amounts of fake, mislabeled "lavender oil" that contains no lavender at all. Instead, it contains artificial compounds like linalyl acetate. These compounds smell almost exactly like real lavender oil, but have no aromatherapy benefit.  This oil has been extracted and concentrated from huge amounts of real lavender flower, using the traditional steam distillation method. When you buy from us, you can be confident that you're getting nothing but real, USDA organic 100% lavender essential oil.

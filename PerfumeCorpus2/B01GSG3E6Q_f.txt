What does an Outlaw smell like? In short, an Outlaw smells like an American hero.  In long, an Outlaw smells like leather, sandalwood, gunpowder, sage, two kinds of campfire (the nighttime campfire and the daybreak campfire), and a little dirt. An Outlaw smells like the sexiest goddamn thing you can imagine, and then about 12 times sexier than that.  An Outlaw is too old for 'Axe' and too young for 'Old Spice.' Too old for rot-gut whiskey and too young to give up whiskey outright.  This solid cologne could be used by the kind of cowboys that other cowboys sing about. This solid cologne is the kind of body wash that makes married men late for work. This signature scent will turn your day into a celebration of every. damn. reason you woke up this morning: because you have Things to Do.  But you don't have to do them too fast. And that's why it's called "the sexiest cologne ever."  Our solid colognes are made in small batches (of just 15!) right here in the USA. They come in very giftable and reusable kraft boxes that have an abbreviated version of the above description, and contain one of a dozen different quotes. The 1 oz twist-top tin is perfect for carrying in your pocket all day.  All our scents are skin-safe and long lasting. Because we feel like scent is a personal thing to be shared between you and those literally closest to you, these are subtle scents. They will not overpower a crowded elevator or make you "that guy with all the cologne." They're designed to create an ambiance, not an impact.  Directions: Swirl your finger along the surface and warm the cologne up a little, rub on your pulse points (wrists, neck).  Ingredients: beeswax, grape seed, coco butter, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, rosemary seed, and fragrance oil.

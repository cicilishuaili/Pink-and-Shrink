Designed for action filled days in the side country, take the first chair up and hike the last bit to the peak before you find a new powder line down. Elevate shell pants have a tailored relaxed freeride cut built with Helly Tech® Professional 3L fabric with a new FLOW membrane enabling an unparalleled breathability, guaranteed to keep you dry, warm and comfortable on the inside. We are using premium freeride specific features throughout including jacket-pant integration buttons, lowered pockets for easy access, large reinforcement and Recco® advanced rescue system.

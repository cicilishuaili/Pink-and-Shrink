A super-technical raincoat artfully disguised as street wear, this waterproof-breathable jacket delivers fully seam-sealed protection in the wettest conditions with a versatile, street-inspired style that excels in mountains and cities alike. The men's Dr. Downpour features a double-ripstop shell fabric with a nice weight and durable, earthy texture, along with travel-oriented details like an interior passport pocket and a hood that tucks seamlessly away into the collar.

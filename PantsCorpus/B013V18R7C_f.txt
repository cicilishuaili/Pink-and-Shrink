Using sustainable fabrics like hemp and recycled polyester, White Sierra is making a difference in the way we do business, one community at a time. our eco-friendly products are made of environmentally friendly materials to enhance the experience and life of our consumers, and to protect the world we live in. We have also taken additional steps to partner with a socially conscious manufacturer who is actively striving for stronger community and individual well being for their workers. In addition to being eco-friendly, the Canyon Capri is garment washed for a softness that gives your top that 'just out of the dryer' comfort even when brand new.

The perfect pair of cozy bottoms to kick back in before a workout or after a long adventure outside, the Mira Capris are the essence of laid-back comfort. These stylish Capri-length bottoms feature our Cool-Lite terry fabric, which blends super-soft merino wool with natural TENCEL, durable nylon and stretchy LYCRA. The elastic waist features an integrated drawcord to help you dial in the perfect fit, and the rib-knit cuffs and waist make for soft contact points.

Find the highest ground with the deepest snow this winter in Mountain Hardwear's Highball Insulated Men's Pants. With the burly construction of 140D nylon paneled with even burlier 160D nylon in high-impact areas, the pants can withstand the gnarliest bushwhacks, snow snakes, and the unfortunate days when your cliff-drops turn to rag-dolling down a bowl of chunder. Mountain Hardwear allows you to skip some of your base layers this time around with the help of toasty Thermal. Q insulation that provides lofty warmth without much weight or bulk, so the last thing you're thinking about during a frigid day with fist-sized-clusters of flakes falling from the sky is where the nearest lodge is.

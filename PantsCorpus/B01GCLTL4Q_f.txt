No need to warm yourself around a crackling fire at the resort's base lodge when you're wearing the toasty Volcom Women's Frochickie Insulated Pant. The Frochickie keeps you pleasantly warm through frigid cold blasts and heat-robbing alpine breezes with its 60-gram Low Loft insulation. Its V-Science Oxford II fabric blocks outside moisture when you're making first tracks through deep powder and slashing across spring slush. Additionally, its triple-reinforced rise prevents premature wear and tear throughout the course of the season. Please note, the Frochickie features Volcom's newest Chino fit, which is slim straight through the leg, striking an ideal balance between freedom of movement and a tailored, body-hugging fit.

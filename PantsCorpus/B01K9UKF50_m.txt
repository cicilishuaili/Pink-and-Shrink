On the trail, on the hammock. You can't live your entire life off the beaten path. So we tempered these G's for cross-terrain living: kicking around town, kicking up the trail, and kicking way back. Smart features include a functional tack-zip fly and integrated buckle belt, flex-fit elasticized waist, gusseted crotch, and a super-smooth fabric: double ring spun organic cotton twill with a great dye and wash for old-favorite softness and fade. The fit is relaxed - sits on your natural waist, with room to move through the seat and thigh, and a straight leg finish. With two front pockets and two back pockets.

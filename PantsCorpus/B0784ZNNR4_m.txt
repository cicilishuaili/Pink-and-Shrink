These Volkl Men's Pro 3D Shell Pants are super technical ski pants designed for use deep in the backcountry, at the resort, and everywhere in between. If you're looking for a technical shell ski pant it really doesn't get much better than these pants from Volkl. They boast impressive levels of waterproofing and breathability thanks to the Dermizax fabric. That fabric has 20,000 mm waterproofing and 20,000 g/m2 breathability, essentially the standard for top of the line, technical outerwear. They have a removable bib that's great for keeping out snow when you're touring in deep powder and also helps keep your pants up thanks to the shoulder straps. It's perfect for layering over your mid layers, allowing you to shed your shell jacket and still be protected from the snow around you when you're hiking or touring. The pant cuffs have very strong reinforcements that will reduce any ripping or tearing from ski edges and the wear and tear of skiing and hiking. The side leg zips come all the way up to the knee, allowing you easy access to your ski boots and other equipment for quick adjustments when you're on the fly. Whether you're an alpine touring enthusiast or spend most of your time at the resort, these shell pants are awesome.

Perhaps you just like traveling to really cold places (hello, Jackson Hole!). The Snowman Insulated Pant has a two-layer hardshell exterior lined with 40 grams of lightweight Spaceloft insulation for that ideal layer of added warmth without feeling bulky or overbearing. You won't notice the thin layer of insulation in the fit or style-it's essentially invisible from the outside, like the best kind of superpower. Five pockets, including a waterproof thigh pocket big enough to stash a breakfast sandwich, massive outer thigh vents, and reinforced cuffs round out the features.

The Rush tights from our Icebreaker GT technical sports collection are made from stretchy mid-weight GT260 jersey fabric and designed for running, the gym and other fitness activities. Falling just below the knee, these tights have a lined gusset for freedom of movement, reflective piping to keep you safe when you're running at dawn or dusk, and a back stash pocket for your keys. The features are all about performance, but the design is streamlined and sexy.

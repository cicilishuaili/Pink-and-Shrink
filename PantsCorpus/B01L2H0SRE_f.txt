We think this is the best fitting pant. Period. Bonus - it looks great on everyone.  It's insulated, but not to warm.  It has stretch, so it can be fitted, but you can still sit on the chair lift, comfortably. So if you're looking for the one quiver pant, this is it.  WaterproofSeam sealed4 way stretchAdjustable waistbandLeg gaiters with elastic grip

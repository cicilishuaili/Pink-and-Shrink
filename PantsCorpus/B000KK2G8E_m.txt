Red Ledge is known for offering cutting edge outdoor apparel at an affordable price and the Men’s Thunderlight pant is no exception. Our own patented T-Core® waterproof/breathable coating is applied to lightweight rip-stop nylon taffeta in conjunction with a DWR (Durable Water Repellant) finish. The Thunderlight pant features include an elasticized waistband with an adjustable draw cord and the pant cuffs have adjustable snaps. As with all our Thunderlight products, this pant comes in it’s own mesh stuff sack for easy storage and portability; but if you’re not a stuff sack sort of person, this pant also will pack into it’s own zippered back left pocket. Weight: 8.9 oz. Be sure to check out our Men’s Thunderlight Parkas!

From the GRAPHITE ALPHA collection comes the "SILVER" men's ski pant by Karbon Technical Apparel of Canada. This is a great pant regardless of how you like to attack the slopes, whether your a big mountain or back country guy, novice or expert, recreational or race you'll love the way this pant fits and performs. The "SILVER" uses Karbon' s proprietary Quadra Stretch fabric, a woven fabric with great durability, and weight, and a stretch component that makes it extremely comfortable. The Quadra Stretch fabric gets a (DWR) Durable Water and Stain Repellency coating, combine that with the Karbonite 20,000mm waterproof/breathable laminate with 100% seam sealing and you'll be well protected from the elements. The 40 weight Thermore insulation is just right for most all winter weather conditions, it's light weight, not bulky but gives you that added buffer to the cold that you'll be glad to have. The "SILVER" is feature rich, with some great attributes like multiple pockets, waterproof YKK zippers, zip fly with Velcro/snap closure, powder cuffs, and adjustable waist. Karbon runs true to size and this pant is no different, typically whatever size you currently wear is probably the size you'll want to purchase in the Karbon product.

The Double Diamond collection for 2015/16 embodies a most aggressive launch into another level of versatile Technical Outwear. The goal of Double Diamond is to bring to market technical outerwear that gives the customer a product loaded with the features they need, want, and expect, and all at a price that shows great value. For over 30 years we have strived to build value into every garment we design and construct. It is a time honored process that many companies talk about but is truly a part of who we are. Our products are designed to be warm, dry, comfortable cold weather gear that can be worn in any condition, from street to back country.

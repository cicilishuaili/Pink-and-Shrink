Warm, waterproof cargo-style ski pant with a cross-hatch m√©lange pattern. 60 Grams of Thermal Q synthetic insulation are tucked away beneath a herringbone-pattern face fabric and five-pocket silhouette to make the Snowburst as good-looking as it is warm. Waterproof/breathable Dry Q technology blocks the elements while allowing perspiration to pass outward. Material: Polyester.

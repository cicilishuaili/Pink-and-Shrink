Sometimes we just need to wear pants as much as we want to be in shorts year round. Our NXTLVL pants will make you happy you did. These start out as a classic button, zip fly, 2 front pocket, 2 rear zip pocket, 1 cargo pant, but that where normal stops. To put a little gas on the fire, we use a lightweight, UPF +30 stretch woven along with a crotch gusset and articulated knees to keep your mobility at a premium. The material is also quick dry, just in case and at the rear yoke and crotch gusset we add laser perforation to further enhance the quick dry / breath-ability of this equipment. Next, we have our auto-adjust waistband that accommodates for additional "insulation" you may gain throughout the season. Our last little touch is the Crescent Cuff - raised along the rear bottom hem so you don't step on your pants. If you have to put pants on, you'll wonder why you've resisted these so long in the first place.

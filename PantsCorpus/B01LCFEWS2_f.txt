Whether you are spending the summer on the Mediterranean or travelling to the equator, the Kalahari 3/4 pants women are always a good choice when it gets really hot. Because these lightweight 3/4-length travel trousers give you very good UV protection and feel really pleasant on the skin. The Supple fabric is not just airy and comfortable, but also dries quickly. This is ideal when you want to give your shorts a quick wash through, or if you get caught in a summer shower. And they hardly take up any space in your luggage.

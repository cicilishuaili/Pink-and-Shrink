Red Ledge is known for offering cutting edge outdoor apparel at an affordable price and the Thunderlight full side zip pant is no exception. Our own patented T-Core® waterproof/breathable coating is applied to lightweight rip-stop nylon taffeta in conjunction with a DWR (Durable Water Repellant) finish. The Thunderlight full side zip pant features include an elasticized waistband with an adjustable draw cord and adjustable Velcro® side tabs. If removing your shoes or boots in order to don a pair of rain pants is not an option for you, the full leg side zippers come in handy and each have interior and exterior storm flaps for superior protection from the elements. The knees are articulated for ease of movement and there are adjustable Velcro® tabs at the cuffs to customize the fit. As with all our Thunderlight products, this pant comes in it’s own mesh stuff sack for easy storage and portability; but if you’re not a stuff sack sort of person, this pant also will pack into it’s own zippered back pocket. Weight: 12.5 oz. Be sure to check out our Men’s and Women’s Thunderlight Parkas!

From huge handrails to massive backcountry jumps, rip everything (except your pants, of course) with the Ride Men's Phinney Shell Pants. Constructed with a protective Strata HD 10 laminate, these pants resist moisture to keep you dry on the mountain. With Ride's Act 1 construction, these shell pants feature zonal lining to help manage temperature. The Phinney Pants are designed to keep you comfortable on the mountain. Inner leg vents help cool things down on warm sunny days or after a strenuous run. Gaiters with hooks prevent snow from sneaking down your boots and soaking your socks, while a snap jacket-to-pant interface provides a seamless fit for added protection. Reinforced cuffs protect your hems from sharp edges for increased durability that extends the life of your pants.

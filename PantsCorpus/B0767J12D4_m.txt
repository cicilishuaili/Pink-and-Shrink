It's always a little tough to predict what the weather might be out on the trails once you're up above treeline, especially during during ever-changing fall days in the mountains. A brisk morning at camp can quickly turn into a snowy afternoon on singletrack, and having kit like the Gore Bike Wear Men's Power Trail WS SO Pant stashed in your pack can make your cold miles a lot more pleasant. Constructed with Gore's signature Windstopper membrane laminates the nylon-elanstane softshell pant to block gusty winds and repel surprise rain (or snow) showers, without weighing you down as you pedal. The pant's slim fit, slight stretch, and articulated knees makes it easy to layer over a liner while still staying out of your way when you're grinding it out on a tough climb. Reinforced seat and inner calf stand up to abrasion and boost the lifetime of the pants with increased durability. Reflective accents help improve visibility during fire road transitions or at roadside trailheads.

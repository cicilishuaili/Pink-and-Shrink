Adapt to your environment with the 3-in-1 prAna Sage Convertible Pant. Push through the undergrowth in a full length pant, use interior tabs to roll up into a Capri for bouldering, and then zip off into shorts when the day is hottest. Water resistance and stretch are a given, while cargo pockets keep your keys and wallet secure at every stage.

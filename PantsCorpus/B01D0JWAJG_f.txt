We've taken our favorite chino style pant and created a high tech, ridable version. The frochickie insulated pant features our exclusive v-science oxford ii fabric with ideal 15,000mm/15,000gm (dnv) 8,000mm/8,000gm (all other colors) waterproofing and breathability. Includes added tech features like critical taped seams and 60gm low-loft insulation for extra warmth. Our v-science breathable lining system is added to keep you from overheating. Crafted with our new chino fit, this design delivers a slim straight leg that's slightly relaxed yet still ultra flattering.

Helikon-Tex homegrown concept has always been based upon the ingenuity of design. The OTP pants were designed based on our signature UTP pants to meet all the tactical requirements needed during outdoor activities. Our patented design stands far apart from any others on the market. The OTP can provide load bearing capabilities combined with durability and comfort. Have you ever had a pair of pants rip out at the seams? With the OTP, that will change. Our 4-way elastic fabric is composed of 93% nylon and 7% spandex. Because of its composition its stretch ability helps take the stress away from a particular part of the pants. This leads to fluent and quick tactical movements. They are also coated with Dupont Teflon for durability and stain resistance. The pants are secured with a velcro waist flap and a metal YKK zippered fly. With its unique pocket set-up, the Outdoor Tactical Pants enable you to carry all your essential equipment in an organized fashion, while keeping your outdoor gear close to your body's center of gravity. They feature a number of useful low profile pockets placed at the front, the rear and on both thighs. The knees also have additional internal pockets on each to add padding for protection. In addition, the stitching on the knees are reinforced to provide durability. EU Patent: 002638791-0001 This listing has been verified and approved by Helikon-Tex. ACCESORIES AND BELT NOT INCLUDED

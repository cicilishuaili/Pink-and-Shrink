An all-day pant that offers a unique combination of performance and style. Made from a blended canvas fabric that's 75% cotton, 23% nylon, and 2% elastane, it's comfortable, durable, and has excellent stretch. Which means it can hang with you wherever you happen to be: riding your bike on your morning commute, at a working lunch with colleagues, or on the underside of a boulder at your local climbing spot after the office closes. Roll the pant legs up and secure them with the snap closures, and you'll notice reflective elements--a unique Mountain Hardwear feature designed to make you more visible in dim light.

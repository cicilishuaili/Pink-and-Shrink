Comfortable and lightweight, these shorts are perfect for commuting cyclists and active individuals. With a relaxed fit, the lightweight fabric allows great flexibility and comfort for all activities and the six-pocket design is great for stashing your U-Lock key, some nutrition bars, your smartphone, and anything else that you carry with you on the bike, down the trail, or in the gym. The waistband features an adjustable belt for a secure fit and the rear belt loop includes an additional loop for attaching a beacon bike light. In addition, reflective tabs on the legs enhance visibility during early morning commutes and late-night group rides. The soft nylon/spandex fabric dries quickly in case you find yourself caught in the rain during a bike ride or knee-deep in a mountain stream during a hike. Each leg opening has an adjustable drawstring to keep the hems free from all of your bike's greasy, moving parts.

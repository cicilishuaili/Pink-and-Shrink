King's Camo: a Family of Camouflage Patterns King's was first established back in 1995 with a graphic design foundation and created a quality publishing company with cataloging, magazine and the award winning King’s Calendars. In 2000 there was a great buzz about new camouflage patterns coming into the industry and the improvement in technology for camouflage patterns. King's set the stage to release their revolutionary King's Shadow Camo Patterns and in 2002 King’s Desert Shadow Camo launched after two years of development and testing. Built upon the notion of lighter terrain, coloration and depth yet to be seen in the industry, Desert Shadow instantly grabbed the attention of hunters and the need for a lighter terrain pattern. Now encompassing a whole family of camouflage patterns, including a popular Pink Shadow, and a King’s Brand that has continued to gain recognition and respect in the industry, King’s Camo has refocused on manufacturing quality products that equal the patterns they carry. The steady interest in the patterns has also increased the official licensee partners that use King’s Camo on their own products.

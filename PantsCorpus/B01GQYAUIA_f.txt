Like its name implies, this versatile wet-dry walking short lets you play all morning on the beach or boat deck and dry off in time for lunch on the pier. It's ultra light and sun shielding, with a quick-dry stretch fabric that facilitates dynamic movement and mesh pockets that let the water drain right through.

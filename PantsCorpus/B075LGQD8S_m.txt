The PreCip Full-Zip Pant features Marmot's comfortable and breathable NanoPro waterproofing technology. NanoPro coating is comprised of densely packed pores small enough to keep water droplets from getting in, but big enough to let water vapor outâ€”providing cool, dry comfort even as your activity level increases. The PreCip pant also features fully taped seams to prevent leaks, full-length side zippers to allow quick and easy layering, and bonded storm flaps over those zippers to keep moisture out. Zippered hand pockets and a zippered back pocket provide storage for your items, and the elastic waist gives you a secure yet comfortable fit with plenty of mobility.

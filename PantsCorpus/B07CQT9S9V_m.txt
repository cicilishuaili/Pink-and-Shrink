The Zoic Men's Ether Short is the Goldilocks short for trail riding adventures with its stretchy, ultra-tough fabric, variety of easily accessible pockets, and built-in ventilation. DuraFlex fabric not only conforms to your every movement while you're sending natural hits and railing around berms, but it's also incredibly resilient against abrasion. Air Flow mesh panels sit below the rear waistband and down the legs, actively cooling your body as you rush down the mountain. One of the best things about the Ether Short is the large variety of functional pockets. In total, you'll find six pockets for convenient storage, including a media-compatible pocket for seamlessly routing your tunes during longer rides. The Fusion Inseam Gusset provides full range of motion while eliminating fabric snags on your seat. And to retain a secure fit, adjustable waist tabs prevent the short from slipping as you're bombing downhills and cranking up steep hillsides.

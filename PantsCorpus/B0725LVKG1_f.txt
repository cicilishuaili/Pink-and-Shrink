A focus on fit. The Women's Seymour Shell Pant was designed with the intention of being the best fitting pair of ski pants you'll ever wear. The flattering cut was engineered to provide perfect articulation while skiing. The Prime10 fabric offers all of the waterproofing and breathability you'd need for a fun day on the slopes. The shell construction allows for custom climate control in all winter weather conditions.

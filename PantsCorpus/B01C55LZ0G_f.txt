Comfortable. One word sums them up. These shorts combine the best of our board short and a button zip fly short. We use our quick drying stretch woven, to withstand all necessary duties on land and water. Enhance with dual front diagonal pockets with secure articulated zip cargo and rear pocket. Add in SPF protection, Stain release to keep the blood/grime from sticking and an anti-microbial to keep from smelling like your catch. These shorts will take care of you from Sunrise to sunset.

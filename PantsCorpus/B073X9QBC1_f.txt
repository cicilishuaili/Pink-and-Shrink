Perhaps youre one of those skiers who wears two layers of long underwear. Or maybe you just tend to run on the cold side. Opt for the Daisy Insulated Pant, which comes with a two-layer stretchy, waterproof exterior lined with a breathable and thin layer of synthetic down insulation. Inner leg vents keep you from overheating and a slim, straight-leg fit flatters all shapes.

Stay warm and stay comfortable in Armada's Lenox Insulated Pants. The traditional, roomier fit gives you room to move, while the lightly-insulated, waterproof shell keeps you warm and dry. If you get too warm by the end of your run, just open the mesh-lined inner-leg vents and let the breeze cool you down on the lift.

Offering fortress-like protection against the elements, the Volcom Women's Knox Insulated Gore-Tex Pants are constructed to keep you comfortably dry through some of the stormiest conditions on the mountain. Made from a waterproof, breathable Gore-Tex two-layer fabric, the Knox excels at keeping wind and water out, and dry comfort in. Low-profile insulation keeps your knees from chattering without creating a bulky look or feel. And when it warms up in spring, mesh-lined thigh vents help you stay cool. The V-Science breathable lining system helps regulate your temperature to adjust with the changing weather, and the Zip Tech pant-to-jacket interface enhances your defense against snow when getting the goods in the deep stuff.

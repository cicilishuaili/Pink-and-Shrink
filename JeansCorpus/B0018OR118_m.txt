Since we invented it in 1873, the 501 Jean has been a blank canvas for self-expression. The iconic straight fit with signature button fly, the 501 Jean sits at the waist and is regular through the thigh with a straight leg. Message from the Manufacturer: You asked. We listened. Based on customer feedback, we've remastered our 501 Jean. The construction of the front fly was modified in 2013 to help prevent tearing in this area.

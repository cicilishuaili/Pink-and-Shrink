A modern slim with room to move, the 511 Slim Fit Stretch Jeans are a classic since right now. These jeans sit below the waist with a slim fit from hip to ankle. This pair has just the right amount of stretch for all-day comfort. Cut close to the body, the 511 Slim is a great alternative to the skinny jean--you'll get the same lean look with added comfort. The narrow leg also means endless style options. For a laid-back daytime look, try a slightly scrunched leg and sneakers. Once night rolls around, try a 2-inch cuff with a Chelsea boot. Every drop counts, so we aim to use less water. Our designers are constantly thinking of new ways to create the same styles you love while cutting back on H2O, such as updating finishing techniques to require less water than traditional processes. These are made using our WaterLess techniques.

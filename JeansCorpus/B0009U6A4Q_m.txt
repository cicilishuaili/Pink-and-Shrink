Functionality meets comfort in our popular Industrial Carpenter Jean. Made of the same 14 oz. premium denim as our Industrial 5-pocket jean, this jean is a true workhorse! The triple-needle stitching on the side seam, yoke, and seat seam, make this jean tough, and the hammer loop, dual tool pockets, and generous relaxed fit make this jean perfect for even the most demanding jobs. With so many features and comfortable pre-washed denim, it is easy to see why the Industrial Carpenter Jean is rapidly becoming the denim jean of choice!

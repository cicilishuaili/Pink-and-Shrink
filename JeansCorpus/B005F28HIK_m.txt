Carhartt quality and comfort work together in Carhartt's relaxed-fit jean. Constructed of tough 15-ounce, 100% cotton ring-spun denim, it sits slightly below the waist and features a relaxed-fitting seat and thighs. Cut in a classic five-pocket style, this rugged jean is a great choice for work; the straight leg openings fit over boots.

A modern slim with room to move, the 511 slim fit jeans are a classic since right now. These jeans sit below the waist with a slim fit through the hip and thigh and a slim leg. This pair was made using premium denim with next-generation stretch for maximum comfort and recovery to keep their shape. Cut close to the body, the 511 is a great alternative to the skinny jean - you'll get the same lean look with added comfort. The narrow leg also means endless style options. For a laidback, daytime look, try a slightly scrunched leg and sneakers. Once night rolls around, try a 2-inch cuff with a chelsea boot.

After the '70s were over, things got more relaxed, including Levi's jeans. In 1985, they introduced the 550 relaxed fit jean. It had the same quality and craftsmanship as the original 501 style, but with more room in the seat and thigh. Today, it's the comfortable classic for guys who want a relaxed look. This pair has just the right amount of stretch in it for all-day comfort.

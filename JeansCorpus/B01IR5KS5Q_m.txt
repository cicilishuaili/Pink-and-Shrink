Since we invented it in 1873 the 501 jean has been a blank canvas for self-expression. True to the original it features the time-tested straight fit and our signature button fly with branded Levi's; shanks. This pair comes in a dark stonewash. Stonewashing is accomplished by washing denim with pumice stones to achieve a lived-in look and feel. This step occurs during the finishing process.

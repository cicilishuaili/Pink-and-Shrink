The original zip fly. First created in 1967, the 505 regular fit jeans are one of Levi's most popular straight fits. Beloved for their classic straight leg style, they are cut to sit at the waist with extra room in the thigh and fall straight down to the ankle. The versatility of the straight leg is great for all body types. No need to choose between style or comfort, this jean has it all. For a modern look, try a thick cuff styled with casual sneakers.

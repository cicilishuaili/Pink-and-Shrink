Super skinny, serious style. If you're looking for a jean that feels like a legging, this is it. Sitting just below the curve of your waist and made from soft blended fabric, the 535 is incredibly comfortable. It also has Levi's skinniest leg opening for an ultra-sleek, sexy silhouette. Need an off-the-moment style trick buy it a tad shorter or cuff the hem to expose a little ankle and elongate your legs.

A modern slim with room to move, the 511 slim fit stretch jeans are a classic since right now. These jeans sit below the waist with a slim fit from hip to ankle. This pair has just the right amount of stretch for all-day comfort. Cut close to the body, the 511 slim is a great alternative to the skinny jean-you'll get the same lean look with added comfort. The narrow leg also means endless style options. For a laid-back daytime look, try a slightly scrunched leg and sneakers. Once night rolls around, try a 2-Inch cuff with a chelsea boot.

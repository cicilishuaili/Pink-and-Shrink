The ultimate pants for everything you do: they could go straight from work to the gym & back again. Light, durable fabric that feels substantial & allows you to move. UA Microthread technology in the fabric dries faster, won‘t cling to you, won‘t chafe & stretches without absorbing sweat. Breathable mesh back panel is still durable, but delivers superior ventilation. Material wicks sweat & dries really fast. Stretch-engineered waistband for superior mobility & insane comfort. Hand pockets with internal left-side phone pocket (fits most bigger models). Back pockets with internal right-side wallet pocket. Elastic binding along outseam holds rolled cuffs. Straight leg fit.

The Air Jordan IV made its initial debut in 1989 and was instantly praised for its unique design. The Tinker Hatfield creation features a 3/4 (or mid) cut similar to the Air Jordan III, large "Flight" logo on the tongue, plastic lace hole accents, and a visible Air-Sole unit. Although the Air Jordan IV did not need help in the popularity department after its release, the Air Jordan IV was famously featured in Spike Lee's "Do The Right Thing" catapulting its appeal into a new realm.

The fabric in SKINS DNAmic Women's thermal long sleeve compression top is twice as warm as SKINS standard fabric, giving additional warmth when you train and compete in colder weather. SKINS scientifically proven engineered gradient compression improves circulation and oxygen supply to your muscles, helping you to perform better for longer with less fatigue and less post activity soreness. Dnamic thermal compression gear is made from a scientifically advanced fabric, developed for SKINS to keep you warm out in the cold without overheating. Our fabric is a blend of polyamide and Elastin, which combines high pilling and abrasion resistance with excellent breath-ability and a soft feel against your skin. The brushed interior helps to release heat back to your body providing you a thermal advantage in cooler temperatures. The Elastin blend ensures excellent stretch and recovery for optimal compression and unrestricted movement. With SKINS products, compression and comfort go hand in hand. Dnamic Women's thermal long sleeve compression tops are available in a mock neck with or without zipper. For additional comfort, the top features underarm ventilation and a silicone gripper at the waist to make sure everything stays in place. SKINS thermal compression will keep you performing at your best, longer, stronger, with less fatigue in all cold weather conditions

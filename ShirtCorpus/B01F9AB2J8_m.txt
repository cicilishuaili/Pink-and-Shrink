Under Armour Men's Team Podium Golf Polo Shirt Top, Assorted Colors. 1276227. The Under Armour Team Podium Men's Polo features Under Armour's game changing HeatGear technology. Unlike ColdGear and AllSeasonGear, which are meant to be worn during winter and fall temperatures, this type of technology is designed to be worn during the extreme temperatures of the summer (75 degrees or above). The super lightweight fabric will deliver excellent coverage, but without weighing you down with any unnecessary bulk or weight. All HeatGear apparel features the Signature Moisture Transport System, 4-way stretch fabric, anti-microbial technology, and a flatlock seam construction. Under Armour's Signature Moisture Transport System is designed to wick sweat away from your body then push it to the surface of the fabric, where it can then evaporate at an incredibly rapid rate. The 4-way stretch fabric also assists with the drying process. Although this fabric allows you to move in any given direction without any restriction or difficulty, it also decreases the amount of time it takes for the fabric to dry. Color: Comes in an array of color options. 1276227

Go from studio to street with the Mission VaporActive Conductor Tank Top. Semi-sheer, mesh back panels add style and breathability. A loose fit in super-soft modal makes this the ultimate in comfort. Classic V-neck and wide straps for bra coverage make it smart and on-trend. VaporActive, powered by patented 37.5 technology, attracts moisture at the vapor level and rapidly removes sweat, keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. Permanently embedded at the fiber level, the fast-drying technology never degrades or washes out. Fabric contains active particles that attract and trap odor-causing molecules, later releasing them in the wash. Care instructions: machine wash cold with like colors. Only non-chlorine bleach when needed. Do not use softeners. Tumble dry low. Do not iron.

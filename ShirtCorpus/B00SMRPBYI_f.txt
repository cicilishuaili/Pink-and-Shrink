The next generation of MCS compression engineered for Alpine skiing, incorporating PWX flex thermal (70D) for added warmth. Mcs is a revolutionary fabric support system traced over key muscle, tendon and fascia groups to focus greater compression to wrap precise areas to reduce muscle oscillation and damage. Mcs is targeted to the core stomach muscles, lower back and oblique to provide greater core support, and help work with/against the power from rotation and centrifugal gravity developed from downhill skiing. Higher neckline for greater warmth.

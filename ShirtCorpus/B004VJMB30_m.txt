It all started in Alex City, Alabama in May of 1902. Over 115 years later, Russell Athletic is bringing its heritage to life. Featuring a collection built on cotton, our Heritage designs are the cool vintage inspired streetwear youâ€™ve been looking for. Sport is who we are, so we designed the retro styles for both men and women featuring graphic tees, tanks, and hoodies to reflect Russell Athletic original sportswear.

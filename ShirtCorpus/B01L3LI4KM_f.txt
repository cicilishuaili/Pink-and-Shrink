From workout to hangout, the Mission VaporActive Alpha Short Sleeve V-Neck T-Shirt is your go to, year-round shirt for training and running. Next-level VaporActive technology, powered by 37.5, rapidly evaporates and removes sweat, drying up to 5 times faster than the leading performance shirt. The permanent technology embedded at the fiber level is chemical free, controls odor and is engineered to never wash out. Active particles in the fibers attract and trap odor-causing molecules, later releasing them in the wash. UPF 20. Care instructions: machine wash cold with like colors. Only non-chlorine bleach when needed. Do not use softeners. Tumble dry low. Do not iron.

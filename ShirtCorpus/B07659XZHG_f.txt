About the Top Focus on your pose, not your cloths. This Gaiam tank is made to reduce restriction, and chafing, all while making you look great. Workout with confidence in active apparel inspired by our yoga heritage and passion for fitness. • Whether you're being active or just pretending (we won't tell) Gaiam workout tanks will have you feeling the flow. Perfect for walking, running, and of course, yoga. • The tanktop features a scoopneck opening and doesn't have any bothersome tags to ensure your top will never break your focus. Gaiam We're just like you. We want to do more-help more, live more, be more active. But the idea that we have to be perfect at everything we do sometimes holds us back. So we at Gaiam try to embrace every part of our perfectly imperfect selves-especially when it comes to yoga. That's why we make yoga, fitness and wellness products for you, just as you are-from the beginner in you to the expert in you. The real you.

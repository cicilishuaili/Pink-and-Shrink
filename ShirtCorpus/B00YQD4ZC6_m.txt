Under Armour Coolswitch Compression T-Shirt The best gym gear helps you work harder! Under Armour Coolswitch Compression T-Shirt gives your muscles that extra boost they need when you're working hard. The smooth and lightweight HeatGearÂ® Sonic technology operates around a moisture management system, rapidly drawing perspiration away from the skin into the mid and outer layers to be evaporated, providing ultimate compression without restriction whilst keeping the wearer cool, comfortable and dry throughout their training. In combination with all the Under Armour Compression features, this shirt is comfortable enough to be worn all day, not only when you want to become invincible in the gym. The intelligent 4-way stretch design is constructed to allow you greater mobility in any direction to enhance your performance. Even when your training heats up, you can keep cool and fresh as the anti-odour technology will reduce any undesired body odour by preventing the growth of odour-causing microbes. Add to this the gear's excellent moisture transport properties that help keeping your body dry whilst wicking sweat away from the skin, and the smooth flatlock seams for a chafe-free motion and reduced skin irritation for a more comfortable fit, and this piece of kit will become one of your favourites.

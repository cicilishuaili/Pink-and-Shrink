Reebok Through tough fitness, we will push each other to honor the body we've been given, because we have only one body to honor. We will endure sweat, tears and even a bit of blood. We will flip tires, sprint hills, and do push-ups until we can't do them any longer. Why do we do this? We certainly aren't flipping tires to be better tire flippers. We're doing it to be better, period. Better leaders; better parents; better stronger, more determined humans-capable of anything. We do it to honor our bodies and sharpen our minds-to be more human.

Under Armour Heatgear Supervent 2.0 SS Training Top Remain cool, dry and comfortable in this short sleeved training top from Under Armour. With excellent breathable qualities, be sure that sweat and moisture won't affect your performance as you strive for the best results. With compression in mind, the Under Armour Heatgear Supervent 2.0 SS training top provides an ultra tight, second-skin fit to allow you to train in supreme comfort and confidence. Under Armour CoolSwitch uses an exclusive coating on the inside that pulls away heat from your skin, making you feel cool and maximise your performance. Breathable ArmourVent mesh back panel is ultra-durable and delivers superior ventilation to minimise the distraction caused by the build up of sweat and moisture. In addition, Anti-Odour Technology works to prevent the growth of odour causing microbes so your garment smells fresher, for longer. Smooth, chafe-free flatlock seams prevent irritation caused by chafing, sweat, and other activity related distractions. Being chafe-free will help your skin feel the benefits of exercise and not be irritated by the fabric. The moisture transport system incorporated into the garment actively and efficiently wicks away the sweat and dries it out so that it does not stay on your skin or within the clothing and cause discomfort as you workout. A full range of movement in any direction is provided by the 4-way stretch fabrication. This benefits you when exercising as you can freely move, and gain the best from your workout.

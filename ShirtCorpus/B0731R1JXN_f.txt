The shoulder Centric support shirt is the perfect definition of wearable wellness. It provides targeted compression to the shoulders and muscles along the spine to help relieve everyday aches and pains, while encouraging an upright, healthy posture. Engineered in comfortable 4D, heavyweight lycra fiber stretch fabric, our innovative design, features compression panels with ergonomic seams for maximum support. The highly wickable fabric keeps you cool and dry, while UPF 50+ protects your skin from the sun's harmful rays. Our patented copper Znergy technology provides premium antimicrobial benefits that last the lifetime of the garment and won't wash out. The light, low-profile design of this back and shoulder posture support shirt lets you wear it comfortably under your clothes or alone.

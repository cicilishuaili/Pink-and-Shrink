Zero Restriction was created by golfers, for golfers. Since 1992 we've been setting the standard for golf apparel using innovative technology and patented features to enhance freedom of motion without restrictions. Working closely with our in-house golf professionals, we perfect our ergonomic fit and develop much of our own fabrics. From start to finish in our design process we use the finest elements available to provide key features like advance waterproofing, breathability, and superior motion. We are constantly evolving and moving beyond the links but our unique pieces are always rooted in our original standards. All components are tailored for the perfect fit, allowing for the movement needed for legitimate golf.

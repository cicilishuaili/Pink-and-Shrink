The SKINS DNAmic Women's tank top is engineered with targeted compression to uniquely wrap and support key muscle groups. In addition to giving you more core strength, the reduction in muscle vibration/oscillation leads to less soft tissue damage allowing you to perform longer, stronger, with less fatigue and less soreness post activity. The enhanced support in your core region encourages better posture as you push through your fatigue curve. Add in a flattering cut, built in shelf bra, exceptional moisture management, and UPF 50+ protection and you have a compression garment that performs on all levels. The A200 tank also includes a silicone hem gripper to stop the top from riding up and reflective taping for visibility in low light training environments. The DNAmic compression tank is sure to become an essential part of your sports wardrobe.

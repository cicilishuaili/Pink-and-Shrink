The SKINS dynamic range brings our original scientifically proven sports compression clothing line to new fit and performance highs. If your sport means that you need to push your upper body to the limit and be fighting fit the next morning, then the dynamic compression top is what you're in need of. Our engineered gradient compression increases blood flow and oxygen supply to your muscles to improve your performance while you are active. The postural support is exceptional, even as you push through your fatigue curve. After your workout you'll feel the benefits of reduced muscle soreness. With SKINS products, compression and comfort go hand in hand. The dynamic range tops feature raglan set sleeves and motion Tech fabric in the shoulder panels to increase freedom of movement. In addition, you'll find underarm ventilation and a comfortable neckline for a good fit and streamlined look. The dynamic compression top also incorporates a silicone gripper at the hem to stop the top from riding up. Three styles available including sleeveless, shortsleeve, and long sleeve. An additional benefit on the long sleeve top are graduated long sleeves to help reduce pooling in the forearms for enhanced blood flow and athletic performance.

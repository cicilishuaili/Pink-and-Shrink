Men's Performance Compression Base layer. The PowerLayer is designed to keep you dry, light and powerful. Works by compressing core muscle areas which helps aid performance and recovery. The unique Polyester-Elastane fabric wicks sweat away from the skin allowing it to evaporate on the surface, keeping you dry and comfortable at all times and performing at your peak for longer.

Under Armour Alter Ego Compression Punisher Team T-Shirt Train to the best of your ability with this Under Armour Alter Ego Compression Punisher Team T-Shirt that provides a variety of technologies that work just as hard as you do whilst you train. Providing an ultra-tight, second skin fit you will not have any restrictions in this t-shirt. HeatGear fabric has all the benefits of UA compression and is comfortable enough to be worn all day, whilst a 4-way stretch fabrication provides greater mobility in any direction allowing you to stretch without any restrictions. A moisture transport system wicks sweat, dries fast and works in concert with the anti-odour technology that works to prevent the growth of odour-causing microbes ensuring your gear stay fresher for longer. UPF 30+ protects your skin from the sun's harmful rays whilst the smooth, chafe-free flatlock seam construction allows the seam to run smoothly against your skin eliminating irritation and blisters.

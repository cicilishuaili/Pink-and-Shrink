The SanSoleil SolCool Print Mock Neck Top offers the next level of cooling UV 50 Protection. SolCool is a SanSoleil trademarked fabric with moisture wicking, quick dry for cooling comfort and UPF 50 Protection. SolCool's light-weight texture cools the skin by up to 7%. Plus SanSoleil's added a vent back to create air flow around the body, cooling even more! (Here's a hint. If you're wearing in dry, arid areas carry a spray bottle with water. Spray a little on the garments arms and shoulders. You'll be amazed at the immediate cooling as the water evaporates!) These garments are great for sports that require fabrics that move and are lightweight for exertion in the sun's heat. Our zip mock top's high stand protects the neck. SanSoleil's prints are designed by our team of artists and are exclusive SanSoleil designs.  Great for: Golf, Tennis, Equestrian, Sailing, Walking, Hiking, Boating, Fly Fishing!

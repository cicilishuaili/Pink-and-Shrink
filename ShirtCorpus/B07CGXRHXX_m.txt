Arctic Cool's revolutionary Instant Cooling Sleeveless Mesh Sides Shirt is the go-to choice for athletes, workout warriors, and anyone who wants to keep cool and comfortable. It features state-of-the-art HydroFreeze X Technology, a cooling management system that reduces the fabric temperature during activity to provide just the right amount of cool to keep you comfortable...not chilled. The sleeveless shirt's design also wicks moisture away from skin and disperses it throughout the shirt, keeping you dry and relaxed. The athletic fir cut of the shirt provides a trim fit and made with fabric that provides full range of motion for all types of activities - if in doubt, go up one size! And its breathable construction is antimicrobial and easy-to-clean. The Instant Cooling Shirt makes it easy to stay cool while you stay active.

Skirt Sports - Free Flow Tee - Stop searching for that perfect workout shirt for women, and tell those Crop Top Cops to put away their tickets. Meet the hottest piece of activewear for women that has also earned the title of the "anti-belly tee." The Free Flow Tee is a lightweight, mesh-paneled Skirt Sports favorite with a longer, relaxed cut that won't strangle your middle or rise up for the world to see.

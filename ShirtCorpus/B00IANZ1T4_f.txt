Elite muscles deserve elite compression gear and our ASICS Inner Muscle Short Sleeve compression top snugly fits the bill. Inner Muscle technology utilizes a highly elastic panel at the back that keeps your shoulder blades in the correct position, opening up the chest and straightening the spine for increased range of shoulder/arm movement as well as lung capacity. A must-have if you're serious about athletic training.

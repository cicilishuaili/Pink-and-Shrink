Shirts vs. SKINS becomes a question of the past with our tricot mesh reversible tank. This reversible Basketball jersey is made from two layers of 100% polyester tricot mesh. Fully reversible for wearing on either side, the bottom hem of each layer is finished separately to allow for embellishment. Equipped with an outside locker label on wearer's left side near bottom hem for personalization, this mesh Basketball jersey is ready for imprinting.

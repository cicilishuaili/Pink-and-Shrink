Gillette MACH3 Cartridge The razor that raised the blade count to three, the original MACH3, continues its legacy of close shaves. Its 3-Blade technology offers a comfortable shave, along with the longevity that comes only with razor blade refills. Its Comfort Guard includes five Microfins to bring you a close, comfortable shave, while the Indicator Lubricating Strip fades to white to show when you are no longer getting an optimal shave. Still a trusted choice, the MACH3 continues to give men around the world a great start to their day.

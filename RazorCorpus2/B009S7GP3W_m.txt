The HB4 four-bladed cartridge comes standard on the HeadBlade ATX and delivers amazing performance due to its flow through design and seamless blade construction. Over three years were spent creating a unique pivot that lets the HB4 or HB6 blade cartridge be used on any HeadBlade, including the original HeadBlade Classic. Contains one adapter and four blades.

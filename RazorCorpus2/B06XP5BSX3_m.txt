With our patented six-blade system, you can cover more ground than ever in a single stroke while retaining the flexibility to reach those tough spots. The tilting head lets you swipe from any direction to quickly mop up any stragglers - especially in the area around your chin and Adam's apple. As you shave, the lubricated strip rejuvenates your skin with a powerful combination of Chamomile, Olive Oil and Allantoin. With most disposable razors, the grip leaves a lot to be desired. The ergonomic grip on the Pace 6 makes the razor feel like part of your hand and prevents those dreaded slips.

Slim your wallet Bellroy puts its heart, soul and countless design hours into helping the world carry better. Every product has been deeply considered to get you moving through life with greater ease. It's our bestseller for a reason The Note Sleeve is an all-rounder that fits your cash and up to 11 cards in a slim profile. Store bills flat across the back, and keep your three daily cards within easy reach in the quick-access slots. A storage area accessed via a convenient pull-tab holds up to eight more cards - but the fewer you can carry, the slimmer your pocket will stay. There's even a coin pouch that doubles as a spot for business cards. This wallet is awesome if you want to slim your pockets, without going to the extreme of true minimalism. Embrace the freedom of slim, and only carry what you really need.  Made from premium leather We use only premium top-grain leather which is double tanned under gold-rated LWG environmental protocols, to make sure it ages much more gracefully than surface-painted leather. This means each Bellroy you pick up not only stands the test of time, it gets better as the years go on.  Backed by a 3 year warranty We pay great attention to our materials and construction. Our products are made to last, and as such come backed by a 3 year warranty from the day of purchase, when used under normal conditions and for the purpose intended. Try not to stuff your wallet with more than the recommended amount, or put things in there that don't belong (like ninja stars for example). If you do, it can stretch the leather and put undue stress on the stitching and other materials. The warranty covers you against faults in materials or workmanship.

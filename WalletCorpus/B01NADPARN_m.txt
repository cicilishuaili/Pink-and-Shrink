Andar crafts unique everyday products that help you organize and minimize what you carry.  The Pilot Front Pocket Wallet is a slim minimalist card holder that's big enough to carry a good amount of cards and cash, but small enough to not bother you when you carry it.  More Than Just a Wallet The Pilot not only can hold several bills in its leather cash strap it uniquely holds several cards and keeps the wallet immensely thin.

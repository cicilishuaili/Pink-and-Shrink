The Trayvaxâ“‡ Element offers a rugged take on a classic leather wallet. We begin with a tough stainless-steel plate wrapped in top-grain oil-tanned leather and secured with MIL-SPEC paracord. This slim wallet is packed with features including a built-in bottle opener, integrated money clip, attachment point, and RFID-protection. The Element is slim enough to slip in your front pocket, tough enough for any outdoor pursuit, but stylish enough for date night or everyday carry. The Element is sourced and Made in the USA and comes backed by the Trayvax lifetime warranty. US Patent No. D775,824

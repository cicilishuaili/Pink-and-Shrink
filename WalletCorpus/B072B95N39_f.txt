RFID (radio frequency identification) is a growing technology that uses radio waves to read and transfer information between devices. Personal cards that currently use this technology include credit cards, transit payment cards, and identification cards such as enhanced driver's licenses.  Why use a RFID wallet?  The information on cards with RFID is vulnerable to theft from nearby persons with RFID readers to scan and capture information on RFID cards without ever physically coming in contact (similar to scanning a barcode). RFID wallets protect cards from unknown scans with the unique protective layering crafted inside the wallet lining.  Package Includes: 1 x Leather Wallet 1 x Luxury Box 1 x Fabric Dust Bag

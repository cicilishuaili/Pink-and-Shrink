Originally created for motorcycle wear, the material was subjected to 70mph crash tests using real pavement during development. At less than .5mm thick, it has enough body to be substantial, yet adds virtually nothing to your load. This layout is based on the Tyvek "MICRO size" but the best construction methods from fabric and leather are applied. Since it can be cut without fraying, the integrated card slot design further contributes to the wallet being 2-3 times thinner than leather wallets. The wallet uses no animal products and is Bluesign certified for its earth-friendly material. Features hybrid ID slot/window with stitched plastic cover. Made in San Francisco. This version blocks RFID signals 13.56 MHz and above (The range found in ID cards, passports, and credit cards). Some building access cards are NOT blocked, which means you may still be able to get in and out of your work doors while still protecting your credit cards from having their digital information taken.

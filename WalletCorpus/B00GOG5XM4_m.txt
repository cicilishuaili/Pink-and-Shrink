Slim your wallet Bellroy puts its heart, soul and many design hours into helping the world carry better. Every product has been deeply considered to get you moving through life with greater ease. For traditionalists who want the benefits of slim Classic in appearance, progressive in features - the Hide & Seek is for those who want to experience clever design and slim pockets, while staying true to existing aesthetics. Holding all of the money and cards you could need, this everyday wallet separates the items you access regularly from the infrequently used. The unique covered compartment means large bills can be concealed from view, while the flat-pack storage section holds extra cards in a secure location without the extra leather bulk. This wallet is available with RFID protection for extra security and peace of mind. It also comes in two heights to accommodate all international currencies. The Hide & Seek is awesome if you want a bi-fold style that remains true to tradition, but still feels slim. It's clever like that.  Made from premium leather We use only premium top-grain leather which is double tanned under gold-rated LWG environmental protocols, to make sure it ages much more gracefully than surface-painted leather. This means each Bellroy you pick up not only stands the test of time, it gets better as the years go on.  Backed by a 3 year warranty We pay great attention to our materials and construction. Our products are made to last, and as such come backed by a 3 year warranty from the day of purchase, when used under normal conditions and for the purpose intended. Try not to stuff your wallet with more than the recommended amount, or put things in there that don't belong (like ninja stars for example). If you do, it can stretch the leather and put undue stress on the stitching and other materials. The warranty covers you against faults in materials or workmanship.

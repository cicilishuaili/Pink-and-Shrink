This is why we've equipped  our genuine leather minimalist wallet with a protective layer that blocks 13-14Mhz electronic signals trying to retrieve your personal information. Thieves use these signaling devices to steal credit  card numbers, expiration dates, identifiable details & so much more. Using an RFID blocking wallet like ours is the easiest & most affordable way to ensure your pertinent info is safe & secure. Though it effectively guards against common radio frequencies, our id window minimalist wallet doesn't have the ability to block 125 KHz signals such as those for hotel room keys & access cards.  No other front pocket slim wallet covers all the bases like this one. Don't let this limited time deal slip away. Click 'ADD TO CART' to order your Buffway RFID Blocking Wallet Sleeve today!

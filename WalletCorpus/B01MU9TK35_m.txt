The Dango Dapper Wallet was designed for the sophisticated individual with an edge. We wanted to incorporate clean lines with contrasting materials and textures. From the boardroom, to a night out on the town, to a cruise down the coast, the Dapper Wallet is there by your side and has your back. It is offered in two color options: a Clear Anodized Aluminum Chassis, Black Silicone Band and either Golden Whiskey Brown Leather or Jet Black Leather with Stainless Steel Mil-Spec Bolts. Yeah it's a mouth full of stuff, but it comes together neatly in one sleek package.

RFID, or Radio-Frequency Identification, commonly involves the use of microchips that contain sensitive financial and personal data that are embedded within passports, credit cards, debit cards, corporate identification cards, student ID cards, and even driver licenses. While carrying any of these items with you, anyone nearby with inexpensive RFID-reading equipment can identify and copy all of the information carried on these microchips. The unsuspecting individual will not even know that his/her identity and information has been stolen. Our RFID Blocking Wallet will insure the safety of this sensitive information.

PROTECT YOURSELF NOW...before it's too late! Imagine a thief walks inches from you carrying a briefcase and scans the radio frequency identification (RFID) chip embedded in your credit cards and passport without removing it from your purse or wallet. A cheap RFID scanner only needs a few inches, while easily available mobile apps perform just as good or better. In 2013 Nilson Reports cited 35 million chip card users in the United States with Visa's PayWave, Master Card's PayPass and many other forms. SAVE THOUSANDS IN LOSSES AND HEADACHES...better safe than sorry Today, identity theft is at your doorstep- people access confidential information freely, while government's expansion on the use of RIFD chips to passports, passport cards, traditional debit cards,and state identity cards creates more opportunity for theft. New RFID tech can scan chips from 15 feet away in a container. It is not only necessary, but essential to protect yourself from your identity being hijacked, credit score being trashed, and worse things we're better off not imagining.

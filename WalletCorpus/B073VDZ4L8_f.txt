What is RFID?  RFID (radio frequency identification) is a growing technology that uses radio waves to read and transfer information between devices. Personal cards that currently use this technology include credit cards, transit payment cards, and identification cards such as enhanced driver's licenses.  Why use a RFID wallet?  The information on cards with RFID is vulnerable to theft from nearby persons with RFID readers to scan and capture information on RFID cards without ever physically coming in contact (similar to scanning a barcode). RFID wallets protect cards from unknown scans with the unique protective layering crafted inside the wallet lining.  Why choose a Dante wallet?  Our wallets are not made with cheap bonded leather like most wallets in the market, but are crafted and sewn together using 100% premium cowhide nappa leather that will endure the wear and tear of everyday use for years to come.  Our wallets are designed to protect without sacrificing in aesthetics. The Compact design includes 6 credit card slots, 1 clear slot for ID, 1 full-length bill compartment, 1 zippered pocket for change. The RFID blocking layer has been tested to block signals ranging from 10MHz and above and does not make crinkling noises as with other RFID wallets in the market.  Our wallets are wrapped and packaged in attractive gift boxes making it the perfect gift for any occasion and are covered by our product lifetime warranty after registration to ensure complete satisfaction with your purchase.  Please note: This wallet shields RFID frequencies ranging from 10MHz to 3000MHz. It does not shield against older proxy cards that operate at low frequencies of 125 kHz.

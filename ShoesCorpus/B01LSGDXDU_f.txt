Vibram's Five-fingers v-trao running shoes provide the perfect balance of proprioception (foot sensory impact) and protection on rugged surfaces. Our two-color 5mm Vibram rubber sole provides impact protection from stones and debris, whilst allowing a more natural running style. The aggressive tread design and Vibram 3D cocoon technology molded into the sole delivers sure-footed grip and protection in all directions. All in all, the v-trail is the ideal choice for the barefoot runner who is looking to take their style to the tough terrain.

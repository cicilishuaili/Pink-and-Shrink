The ride 9 is out of the lab and ready to run. Now featuring Everun, the ride 9 delivers our signature neutral running experience with more energy return than ever before. Everly is a dramatically more lively and responsive material positioned closer to the foot via top sole construction, providing smoother landings in the heel and reduced pressure in the forefoot. The ride 9 truly makes every mile feel as effortless as your first.

The gel-kayano 23 shoe features our revolutionary flytefoam technology for the optimal balance of lightweight cushioning comfort for a luxurious ride. The fluid fit upper leverages seamless stretch mesh reinforcements to increase forefoot support, while adapting to the foot's natural motion to create a custom sock-like fit. Our forefoot and Rearfoot gel cushioning systems absorb shock upon impact to equip overpronators with a smooth and effortless transition between heel strike and toe-off phases.

 We've taken our best-selling Altra road shoe and enhanced the breathability features in the upper for even more comfort. All other features of this favorite stay the same so rest assured that you will get the same soft, responsive, lightweight feel of A-Bound cushioning that you love about the Torin. The FootPod outsole maps the bones and tendons of your feet for natural flexibility, while the FootShape toe box and fully cushioned Zero Drop platform encourage natural, proper form and happy toes. And Fit4Her technology means every shoe is made to fit the unique shape of a woman's foot.

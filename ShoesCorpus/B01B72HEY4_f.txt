The lone peak 3.0 was inspired by one of the most rocky, rugged mountains in the wasatch range and was designed to tackle the gnarly terrain of the wasatch 100. It features our signature combination of fully cushioned zero drop and a foot shape toe box along with other trail dominating features. Sandwiched stone guard technology offers protection from rocks and other trail debris while the carbon rubber trailclaw outsole combines unique uphill lug traction for every trail condition.

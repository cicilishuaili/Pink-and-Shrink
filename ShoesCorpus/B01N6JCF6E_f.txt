If you loved the Olympus 2.0 you'll love the 2.5 even more. While the awesome, grippy Vibram MegaGrip outsole is retained, the upper has been reinforced to not only help eliminate blowouts, but be more breathable. The Altra-exclusive GaiterTrap has been updated to a new 4-point system that keeps your gaiter even more secure than before for aggressive terrain. The Fit4Her technology, Footshape toe box and Zero Drop platform give you comfort and stability on any terrain.

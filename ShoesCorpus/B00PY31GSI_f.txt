True to its heritage, the new gel-kayano 22 takes a bold step forward in unsurpassed performance and modern design. The sleek new fluid fit upper is built with seamless construction and a re-engineered heel clutching system for a more secure and adaptive fit. Mild to moderate over pronators will be treated to the luxuriously plush comfort of the new comfordry lasting and comfordry x-40 sockliner sitting atop the stable fluid ride platform.

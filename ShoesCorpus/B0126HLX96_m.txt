Worldwide, we've sold more mojito's than just about any other shoe we've ever made. It's a cult classic, available for men and women. Look at the styling - the mojito traces its lineage to a rock shoe we made years ago. The sole draws upon the suportive, hikeable vibram spyder of the popular zen. The leather, well....nobody does leather like the italians. Beautiful, comfortable, and still made in europe.

Not legally approved - the xc700 series continues as a staple for emerging cross country runners. In its fifth version, an aggressive new bottom unit combines with a premium upper for all around performance. A new 6-spike (or rubber) outsole with extra exposed eva allows for enhanced traction in any elements. The new upper features a hidden internal support cage and aggressive design to give beginning xc runners an extra edge.

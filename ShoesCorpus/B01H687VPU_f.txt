Known for its revolutionary approach to running, HOKA ONE ONE attacks stability with the Arahi model. Incredibly lightweight and cushioned, the ARAHI shoe reinvents the concept of support. Equipped with HOKA's new J-Frame TM technology, designed to enhance the bucket seat, it provides support and protection while guiding the foot without the use of rigid materials with little tolerance. We call this dynamic stability. We believe this technology embodies the future of the running shoe. Hoka Arahi Women's Running Shoes 3D Puff Print Upper The upper of the Arahi is made with a 3D Puff Print Frame which is superbly lightweight and offers a secure and superbly comfortable fit around the foot. Plush padding has been added to the tongue to let it sit comfortably against the foot and to help prevent chafe and discomfort. Air Mesh panels have been strategically placed on the upper to allow cool air into the shoe at the same time as allowing warm air o be released, giving the shoe superb breathability and keeping the inside of the shoe as cool, dry and comfortable as possible. Meta Rocker Midsole The Early Stage Meta Rocker chosen for the midsole is specifically designed with a low heel-to-toe differential and works like a rocking chair for your foot which allows the foot to be guided effectively through the natural gait cycle. A new Hoka technology called the J-Frame which is designed to enhance the active foot frame and to deliver support and protection at the same time as guiding the foot without the use of rigid materials. Zonal Rubber Outsole The outsole is made from a durable rubber which will keep the bottom of the shoe from wearing away easily. Zonal rubber has been strategically placed in key areas along the outsole that are more likely to wear to give it extra durability, making sure you can turn to this shoe time after time for your running sessions.

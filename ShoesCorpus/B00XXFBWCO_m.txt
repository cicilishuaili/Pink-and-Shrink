Our new High Jump Pro track & field spike features an asymmetrical sole design (left foot take-off) and formfitting upper for the ultimate high-jumping performance. The 11-pin spike configuration allows for variable traction patterns, while the lightweight shark skin outsole minimizes scuffs and scrapes.

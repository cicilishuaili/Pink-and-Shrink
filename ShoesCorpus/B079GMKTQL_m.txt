The original Air Max Zero is definitely a slice of history, but don't think for a second that Nike stopped there and called it a day. The Air Max Zero has been updated with current Nike innovations such as the lighter phylon outsole of the Air Max 1 Ultra, seamless uppers that provide support without adding extra weight, and a lighter, breathable yarn mesh. These features don't just add a contemporary edge to a historical design, they help to fully realize Tinker Hatfield's original, groundbreaking vision.

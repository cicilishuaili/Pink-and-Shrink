Hit the streets running with the Nike Kaishi running shoe from Nike. These lightweight soles feature a slightly padded footbed and almond-shape toe for total comfort. The Kaishi is reminiscent of the Roshe style, but with more rigid support and better for athletic performance to support the foot in all types of athletic movement - running, walking, hiking, or street style.

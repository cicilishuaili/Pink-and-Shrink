Engineered to be the best crossfit shoe on the planet, the new 5.11 RECON Trainer combines agility and comfort with unbeatable performance. A stretch mesh upper provides enhanced ventilation to keep your feet cool and dry, while HELCOR leather bindings ensure flexibility and strength. The full-length CMEVA midsole adds structure and support, a broadened forefoot promotes toe splaying to maximize engagement and improve balance, and the integrated Rope Ready Zone provides assistance when climbing. An 8mm forward angle drop from heel to toe creates a lower profile that increases acceleration and maneuverability while remaining lightweight, and authentic OrthoLite insoles provide cushioned comfort in any environment. From the gym to the track, the RECON Trainer crossfit shoe takes your workout to the next level.

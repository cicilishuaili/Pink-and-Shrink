You asked, and we delivered. Our popular, max-cushioned trail shoe returns with a completely revamped Vibram outsole and a softer, more flexible upper. The new outsole dramatically enhances traction in uphill and downhill terrain while maintaining the max-cushioned feel you love. Traction and durability improvements have also led to a reduction in weight over its predecessor for a faster ride. An impressive 36mm stack height runs evenly from front to back and features an a-bound bottom layer to add a spring to each step and eva top layer to take the bite out of the rugged terrain. AND like every Altra shoe, the footshape toe box keeps your feet happy, relaxed and stable through uphill climbs and downhill descents.

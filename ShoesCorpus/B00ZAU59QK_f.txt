The gt-2000 4 is the core runnerâ€™s bread and butter with its balance of cushioning and stability, outfitted by the comfortably supportive dynamic duomax and guidance trusstic system that also enhance gait efficiency. Our rear foot and forefoot gel cushioning systems are now even more adaptive, assisting mild to moderate over pronators alike with greater support, while the fluid ride midsole offers the ultimate ride.

The torin 2.5 maintains the lightweight, cushioned and form-improving benefits of its predecessor with a new look and extra flexibility. The footshape toe box allows your toes to spread out naturally for more stability and speed. The high level of cusioning includes our responsive a-bound compound that returns energy into each step and is weight-balanced from front to back to encourage low-impact landing. Footpod outsole technology maps the bones and tendons of your foot for a free, natural flex. Let your foot do its thing and run better with the torin 2.5.

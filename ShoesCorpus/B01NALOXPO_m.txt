The Timp fits into the cushioning sweet spot between the Lone Peak and Olympus, great for longer, technical training runs and ultra distance races. Altraâ€TMs PFS performance last and lower volume fit give you reduced lateral movement and a secure fit, while the durable, reflective upper and MaxTracTM outsole complete the package of an all-around cushioned gnarly terrain-eater.

Why keep a boring pair of reading glasses that you keep hidden at home, at your bedside? Here at Sunglass Stop, we believe in reading glasses that complement your day-to-day wardrobe and make a statement -- Classic and contemporary. Professional and youthful. Colorful and bold. We tapped into classic styles that have withstood the test of time, and then added a modern spin to them, to create fashion-forward frames that aspire for striking and sophisticated self-expression. Our uniquely designed glasses won't just be for when you are curled up in bed with a book; Whether it's for work, a Friday night out with friends, for that next convention or gallery opening, or simply hanging out with family for the weekend, our glasses are here to channel your creativity and style. Sunglass Stop took the iconic Wayfarer and updated it with splashes of color to create these Colorful Wayfarer Retro Readers -- Available in a wide variety of eye-catching colors that are perfect for every season and with any outfit!

Enhance your spectacle collection in anticipation of the backyard barbeques and volleyball matches happening in the near future with the Oakley Holbrook Sunglasses. See the spikes with the UV ray-filtering Plutonite lens, which also exhibits excellent peripheral vision thanks to its 6-base lens curvature. Cheap shots to your face won't yield costly consequences thanks to the durable but lightweight O Matter frame material, while the Three-Point Fit keeps the glasses snug and your head in the game. Shaun White helped create the Holbrook as an everyday summer shade based on the classic big frames of the '50s and '60s, and with the optional, glare-eliminating Iridium lens coating, you can squeeze as much function as fashion out of these shades.Product FeaturesFrame: O-MatterHinge: steelLens: Plutonite (polycarbonate)Interchangeable Lens: noPolarized: noFace Size: mediumFrame Measurements: Case Type: Nose Pads: noTemple Pads: noRecommended Use: casual, streetwearManufacturer Warranty: 1 year

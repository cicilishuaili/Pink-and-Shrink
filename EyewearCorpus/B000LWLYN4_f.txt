The original Neoprene Eyewear Retainer -- patented in 1978 -- remains one of Croakies' most popular models. Made of snug-fitting, grippy neoprene material, its ends tightly grip your frames, so while you may lose yourself in your favorite activity, your glasses will remain securely strapped to your head.

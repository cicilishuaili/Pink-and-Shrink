Seek REVO Mirror coating differs from other type of mirror coatings because the color is much more vibrant and strong. Our REVO mirror coating, besides giving your sunglass lenses color, brilliance, and style, also protect your eyes from harmful sun rays. The REVO reflective mirror changes color dramatically depending on light and angle. REVO mirrored lenses provide an sharp look that will make any frame stand out! Seek REVO Mirror is a color mirror layer made of insulated materials, which was initially invented to reflect the sun's rays off satellites. A layer of approx 4 nanometers is applied in an even layer on the surface of the lens. The result is a one-way mirror that completely shields your eyes from excessive direct heat and from harmful UV rays. Mirror coating optimizes the available light in your environment to enhance the clarity of your vision and in the meantime conceal the wearer's eye for maximum privacy.

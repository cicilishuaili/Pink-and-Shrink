WearMe Pro was founded in 2011 with one simple goal - to provide high end fashion without the high end price tag. You shouldn't have to take out a personal loan in order to look and feel good. Thankfully, with WearMe Pro, the latest trends are more affordable than ever.  At WearMe Pro, our focus is on producing the highest possible quality sunglasses at the lowest possible price. Our designs take inspiration from the very latest trends, bringing you styles that often haven't even made it into the stores of the high-end retailers. All of our lenses are 100% UVA and UVB protected, and every pair comes with a microfiber cloth/case, to ensure your sunglasses stay clean and scratch free for years to come.  Why should you choose WearMe Pro? We are a family owned company with a customer-centric philosophy - we're only happy if you're happy! We hand pack our orders, and love to hear our clients' thoughts on both our products and fashion in general. We understand that our customers are the lifeblood of our business, so if you've got any thoughts or recommendations on trends or designs, don't hesitate to contact us!  On top of the incredible quality and value of our products, we also offer a 30 day satisfaction guarantee, allowing you to return or exchange your sunglasses absolutely free, and we offer free domestic shipping within the USA. The latest looks and the highest quality construction at a fraction of the price. That's the WearMe Pro difference.

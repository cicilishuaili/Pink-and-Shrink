Tired of scratching or losing your favorite sunglasses when they fall off your hat? Millions of us instinctively place our sunglasses on our forehead, hats and caps. It's the most handy place and better than hanging them on our shirt collars or pockets.Traditional sunglass straps do the job, but they're uncomfortable to wear around our neck and often get in our way when we bend down. Sunglass neck straps use cotton, neoprene or surgical wire to attach to sunglass handles. However, over time cotton and neoprene begins to lose its hold, while straps with plastic ends can become stretched, crack and degrade.Common Sense Inventions Inc. have designed a unique solution for hat wearers that is easy to use and incredibly cool!

We endeavor to provide quality products at prices which provide value to our customers.   Polarized Sunglasses Polarized sunglasses have a filter that works to prevent the glare from reflecting on flat surfaces (water, snow, road pavement) which interfere with vision. They can be highly useful for sports, driving, and fishing by helping the participant in these activities to see more clearly. They provide premium protection against the sun's harmful rays.   Why are polarized sunglasses better than normal sunglasses? Polarized sunglasses can selectively eliminate the reflection from light coming from above the water surface while normal sunglasses don't have that function.

At Dynamix, our priority is to provide you with lenses that embody superior clarity and stay on top of industry standards. As we are a certified optician, we use our knowledge of Rx background to ensure the quality of our lenses by being involved in the entire process of production, starting from sourcing formidable raw materials to streamlining the thickness, color density, and axis of polarization of the lenses. Such are our efforts in providing you with a product that is of high precision and protection, as well as with services unrivaled by others.   Precisely-aligned Polarization  We take polarized lenses a step further, in that our lenses are firstly cut in pairs to align their axis of polarization of each side of the lenses. We find this step to be imperative in avoiding unwanted glare in either lens that may occur otherwise.   Protection  We take protection seriously. Every Dynamix lens blocks harmful UV rays at 100% and exceeds ANSI Z80.3 impact resistance to keep your eyes safe and comfortable.   Tight & Secure Fit  Using the world's most advance lens edger, every pair of lenses is cut with precision five axis dry milling cutting technology to give you a fit with absolute security.   Remarkable Clarity  Our lens tint is based on customer feedback. We design our tint to work best for everyday use where light transmission and view tint are balanced to give you crisp vision in detailed clarity.   Peace of Mind  Our lenses come with a lifetime warranty as we make it our key focus to guarantee you satisfaction. While we recognize that defects may occur with time, rest assured that we are fully responsible for our products.

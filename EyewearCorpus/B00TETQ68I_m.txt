Our eyeglasses strap is an economical way to keep your eyewear on your body and ready when you need them. Perfect for all activities including extreme sports. Your glasses will hang down low enough to be out of the way when you don't need them. If you don't want your sunglassess to slip down your nose, you simply slide the neoprene eyewear retainer up closer to the front of the frame and your glasses won't move. After you add in our Lens Wash you will see there is no better deal anywhere.

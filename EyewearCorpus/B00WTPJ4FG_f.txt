Durable and elegant eyeglass and sunglass holder, made with quality beads held by a sturdy and flexible string. Includes two metal clips that can be easily attached by removing the end loops. The metal clips are padded inside, so they can be attached to the temples (the sticks of the eyeglass frame) without scratching them. Also, the clips can transform this eyewear holder into a lanyard, to hold badges, ID cards, hotel and cruise ship cards, and more. Total length: 28 inches.

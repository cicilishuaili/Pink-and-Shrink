Very practical eyeglass case of/ on without removing your belt protects frames and lenses :Some Frames have a large bend in the temples (arms) so yur glsses may require that you put the frame front in the case 1st, then fold the temples (arms) out side the case and then fold and snap the case closed, this is the proper way to use the case no matter what the frame size, the frame is securly enclosed in the case while keeping the temples safely away from the lenses so they don't scratch them. then you use the double snap/strap to apply the case to your belt with out having to remove.

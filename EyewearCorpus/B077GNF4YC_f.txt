 FIND SojoS Vision WORTH TO TRY AND TRUST   SojoS Vision loves the sunshine, natural beauty, and of course - beautiful eyes. We design each of our glasses with comfort, lift, and spirituality in mind to fit your lifestyle.   Our name was inspired by the secret in your eyes, coming from the Spanish 'ojos' (eyes).   There is truly a story behind everyone's eyes, and we take pride in creating beautiful eyewear that not only protects, but showcases the mystery of your eyes.   We believe...   • Different eyewear should bring you different emotions, and match your personality and lifestyle.  • 'The best doesn't always mean the most expensive - everyone has their own preference!   • Beauty follows you here.   WHAT YOU GET  Eyeglasses * 1  Collapsible Eyeglasses Case * 1  Soft Glasses Cloth * 1  Exquisite Packaging * 1   HOW TO CARE  To avoid damage, never clean your eyeglasses with paper towels or clothing, and also avoid using household detergents or soaps. While a few mild soaps don't harm lenses,  today's extra strength soaps are powerful enough to slowly disintegrate lens.

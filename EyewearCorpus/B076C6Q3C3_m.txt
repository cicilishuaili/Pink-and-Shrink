The highest quality eyewear retainer ever made. Designed in the South by an avid outdoorsman. At Cottonwood, we've had as much fun wearing our straps as we did creating them. They've been on countless fishing trips and to football games. They've been to business meetings and to weddings. We've even cracked open plenty of bottles with the patented bottle opener we package with every strap. We've taken great pride in creating and refining things that people love to use and we're constantly excited for the next product. No matter where you are or what you're doing, Cottonwood wants to be along for the ride. Always, "Made for a good time."

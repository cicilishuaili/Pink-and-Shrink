Sintillia's RoseÂ´n Glowing Sunglass Strap features a vintage inspired gold colored chain. This style is skinny (6mm wide) and is lightweight thanks to its hollow center. This fashionable croakie is 23 inches long. The skinny style is also available from Sintillia in Silver and Gold. The attachments are adjustable to fit any size eyewear by sliding the metal spring up and down. A much cuter take on the traditional croakie you'll love wearing your Sintillia chain on a daily basis. Sintillia is about celebrating life and being adventurous. All sunglass straps are designed and inspired by a combination of hair-pieces and body jewelry.  If someone is going to invest in an expensive accessory like sunglasses or everyday eyewear, there should certainly be a fashionable way to protect them! It's the perfect addition to a music festival, wedding, travel, beach, BBQ or holiday outfit. Basically anywhere the sun may take you, Sintillia is there to serve as both a fashionable & practical addition to your attire. Sintillia believes every accessory should be a personal expression, and sunglass straps or eyewear chains are no exception to the rule.

Scratch Resistant Exterior Coating 2. Optical Quality Polycarbonate with 100% UV Protection 3. High Efficiency Polarized Film 4. Optical Quality Polycarbonate Perfect Fit Crafted using state of the art edging (cutting) equipment that utilizes laser guidance to craft the lenses to the right dimensions and size, ensuring a perfect fit for the frame. All lenses undergo very strict testing and continuous evaluation to ensure the exact specifications of the brand manufacturer are matched accurately. 100% Polarized The entire line of LenzFlip® lenses are polarized, providing users with glare-free vision. Compared to non-polarized lenses, polarized lenses eliminate 100% of glare-causing horizontally oriented light, providing crisp and clear vision. Polarized lenses also reduce eye strain and improve overall visual comfort. Unlike competitors, LenFlip's polarization technology is based on encapsulating the polarization film within the lenses, rather than using a polarized coating on the lens which can separate or fall off over time. 100% UV Protection LenzFlip® lenses provide the user with 100% protection from harmful UV rays that can damage the eyes over time. All lenses have UV protection built within the polycarbonate material itself, providing the user lasting UV protection that never wears off. PROUDLY CRAFTED IN THE U.S.A.

Quintessentialz - Easily attach the Sunglasses Case with the carabiner to your bag. The Self Closing Soft Sunglasses/Eyeglass Neoprene Cell Phone Squeeze Top Case can be used to carry large to small sunglasses and readers. It is large enough to fit plus sized cell phones such as the iPhone 6 and 7 Plus and Galaxy Notes. Use the included carabiner or mobile clip to attach the case to backpacks, bags, purses and more. NOTE: Because the opening is a squeeze top opening there will be a very small gap in the opening around 1 to 2 mm, for sunglass the strength of the closing top hold them inside but for thin objects such as a cell phone or credit card, etc. may slip out. Though the weight of the phone will keep the pouch right side up making it difficult for a phone to fall out unless the opening is turned upside down. In order to offer both a Carabiner attachment and a Mobile Clip Attachment, the Mobile Clip attachment is not attached and has to be attached using the attachment ring included using a tool such as pliers, or the use of a quarter to squeeze the ring together (not included) in order for the mobile clip to be used. Sunglasses pouch. Cell phone pouch.

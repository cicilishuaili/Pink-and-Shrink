How Do Polarized Lenses Work?  Light reflected from surfaces such as a flat road or smooth water generally is horizontally polarized. This means that, instead of light being scattered in all directions in more usual ways, reflected light generally travels in a more horizontally oriented direction. This creates an annoying and sometimes dangerous intensity of light that we experience as glare. Polarized sunglasses reduce glare reflected off of roads, bodies of water, snow, and other horizontal surfaces.  Polarized sunglasses cut glare and haze so your eyes are more comfortable and you can see better.

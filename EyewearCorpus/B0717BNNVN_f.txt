It is comprised of very high energy and a low wavelength very similarly to UV light. All of our electronic devices with a back-lit screen give off large quantities of blue light (Iphones, Ipod, Laptop, Computer TV.)This blue light messes with our internal clock making us think it's mid day when really it can be closer to night and stops our body from naturally producing the melanin that helps us fall asleep late at nightLifetime breakage warranty on frame & lenses 30 days money back guaranteeINCLUDES 1*hard zipper EVA case1*cleaning soft clothCARETo avoid damage, never clean your computer glasses with paper towels or clothing or alcohol, and also avoid using household detergents or soaps.

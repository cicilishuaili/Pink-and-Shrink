Native Dash XP Sunglass Replacement Lenses let you quickly adjust the view by just swapping what's inside your Dash XP frame. When the sun is bright, use a light-blocking lens. When you're playing in the trees and just need something to protect your eyes from dust, use something closer to clear. You get lots of options without having to buy a lot of frames.Product FeaturesMaterial: PCC (polarized crystal carbonate)Polarized: Compatibility: Native Eyewear Dash XP sunglassesRecommended Use: Manufacturer Warranty: lifetime

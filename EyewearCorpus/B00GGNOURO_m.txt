Clic readers have a unique and patented neodymium front connection system, connected to an adjustable form-fitting headband. To put on the Clic readers, simply place the band around the head, and the magnetic connection will guide the lenses closed. To remove, you simply separate the eye pieces and allow the Clic readers to hang around the neck. The optical quality lenses can be replaced with prescription lenses. For shipment in the United States only.

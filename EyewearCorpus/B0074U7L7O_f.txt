Replacement lenses are made of premium Plutonite lens material, an innovation that blocks 100% of all UV radiation. Oakley's CAD/CAM engineering makes lens replacement simple, yet maximizes impact protection while the lenses are installed. For select goggles, choose an optional Iridium lens coating to minimize glare and tune light transmission.

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THOSE FISH THAT TAG ALONGSIDE SHARKS AND WONDER WHY AN APEX PREDETOR WOULD TOLERATE A DIMINUTIVE FISH TO FOLLOW IT AROUND? Well, those fish are called pilot fish and, believe it or not, sharks welcome them! In exchange for protection, the pilot fish keeps the shark free of harmful parasites and is even known to swim into a shark's mouth to clean up small bits of excess food. Like a pilot fish to a shark, our retainers follow your sunglasses (and you) wherever you go. The relationship is mutual.

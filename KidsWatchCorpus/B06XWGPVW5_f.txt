Orange & Yellow Flowers Design Adjustable and Washable Elastic Fabric Strap Perfect for little wrists - comfortable too - Safety Stainless Steel Silver Clasp Length from end to end = 8 inches = 20 cm = 200 mm. However, this watch band is made out of elastic, which means that it can stretch to accommodate larger adult wrists comfortably. Will also fit the following Timex Youth Analog Watches: T7B151, T89022, T89001, TW7B99500, TW7C059009J, TW7B99400. The elastic band makes it easy on and off, but not so much that it will slide off by itself. In addition to fitting on Timex Youth watches, this strap can practically fit on any watch measuring 16mm at the end lugs, and it is long enough that an adult can wear it comfortably.

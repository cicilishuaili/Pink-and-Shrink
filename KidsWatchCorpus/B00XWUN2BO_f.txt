Up to twelve daily alarms may be set. The alarms have a 20-second duration but may be cut short by pressing any button. The programmed alarm times can be turned on or off as needed. The VibraLITE Mini can be locked after programming in order to avoid accidental setting changes. The lock-out feature can also be used to prevent children from tampering with programmed settings.

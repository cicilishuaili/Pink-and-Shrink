How to set the time: Step one:tap the face of the watch .Tap the face of the watch firmly 6 times after lights end blinking(come from the first tap ) and then hold with your finger until the white "hour" light starts blinking quite rapidly (approx. 4 seconds). Step two: tap the screen until the watch is at the correct hour (approx. 3 seconds) and then hold down the watch face until the latest minute starts blinking rapidly. Step three: You're going to, again, tap the watch face until you get to the correct minute and then hold down the watch face 3 secs.It will enter into setting the function whether to turn on the automatic display mode(every 15 minutes will display the time) or not. Step four:When the white 12 o'clock "hour" light blinking it means the watch turn off the automatic display mode. While the light starts blinking quite rapidly between "12 o'clock" and "6 o'clock", it means the watch turn on the the automatic display mode.You just tap the watch face 1 time to change these two modes.

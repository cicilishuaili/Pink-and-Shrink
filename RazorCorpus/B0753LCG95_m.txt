Harry's Men's Razor with 10 Razor Blades has everything you need for a superb shave. Harry's razor blade cartridges are engineered at its world-class factory in Germany that has been producing some of the world's finest blades for almost 100 years. Each cartridge features 5 razor blades with precision-honed edges that are both durable and sharp, a flex hinge that contours to your face, a lubricating strip for a smooth finish, and a precision trimmer for those hard-to-reach places. The handle is designed with a texturized grip pattern, rubberized matte exterior, and a weighted core for maximum control and grip. It may be the second best-looking thing in your bathroom (second to you of course).

Gillette Fusion5 ProShield men's shaving razor, with lubrication before & after the blades, shields from irritation while you shave. It features a razor handle with FlexBall technology which responds to contours and gets virtually every hair, and 5 precision blades for incredible comfort (vs. Mach3). With Gillette's thinnest and finest blades (first 4 blades, vs. Fusion5), ProShield allows less tug & pull (vs. Fusion5). The Precision Trimmer on the back is great for hard-to-reach areas such as under the nose and sideburns. One razor blade refill equals up to one month of shaves. Fusion5 ProShield razors fit all Fusion5 blade refills.

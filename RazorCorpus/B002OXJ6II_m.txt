3. Parker's SRB Straight Edge Barber Razor is designed for personal and professional/barbershop use. This razor has a snap lock to secure the blade in place as well as many other features found only in high-end models. This razor will hold either professional half blades or half of a double edge blade. We believe this razor is of unparalleled value and quality and it has been designed for personal and barbershop use. Also included are 5 Shark Super Stainless barber half blades, the first choice of many of our barbershop clientele as these provide a much more precise and accurate fit than breaking a double edge blade.

Gillette’s best razor blades are 2X preferred when used with the Fusion ProGlide Razor with FlexBall Handle Technology (overall preference vs. former ProGlide, among ProGlide users). Gillette Fusion ProGlide Razor Blades feature a precision beard trimmer for accurate edging. Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blades are Gillette’s #1 on sensitive skin. Reengineered Low Cutting Force razor blades feature thinner, finer edges (first four blades vs. Fusion) with advanced low-resistance coating to cut effortlessly through hair with less tug and pull than Fusion. A Blade Stabilizer maintains optimal razor blade spacing for comfort, while allowing the razors blades to respond to the contours of a man’s face. Plus, the Streamlined Comfort Guard channels excess shaving cream to produce optimal blade contact, stretching the skin for a close, comfortable shave. And the razor blade's Enhanced Lubrastrip (vs. MACH3) is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blade to move smoothly over skin, even on repeat strokes.

Our Twin Blade razor is the one that you thought wasn't being made anymore. This is a solid metal razor that has a "heavy-in-the-hand feel." The rubber grip rings provide a sure grip, even with wet slippery hands. Both beautiful and economical, this combination delivers an extremely smooth and close shave. This razor accepts any standard twin blade cartridge, and we provide 10 Personna blades with the Lubrastrip with this package. The cost of refills for this razor is much less than the 4 or 5 blade razor cartridges yet we believe the shave is smoother due to less pull and increased razor handle weight. This razor is sure to please!

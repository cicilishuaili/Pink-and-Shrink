With the Mike the Mason Perfect Shave Kit you are on your way to looking and feeling great. Shave like our super cool dads and grandpaps used to. Reduce razor burn, uncomfortable tug, and make shaving something you enjoy doing! This is the perfect razor for any beginning wet shaver. This razor is rated as a mild-intermediate razor. As the razor becomes more aggressive, the closer the shave. Feel the difference with this wet shave kit as well as the savings on your wallet. No more expensive cartridges. New blades cost a fraction of what the big brands charge you for cartridges. This razor is also great for those of us that sometimes let our 5'o clock shadow get a little too long for your typical cartridge razors. That is no longer an issue with the use of our Hawk razor. Feel the difference. With our INSTIGATUH brush you will undoubtedly notice why we use badger hair. Badger hair has been known to be the best for its softness as well as its ability to exfoliate your skin before a shave but it is also exceptional for creating lather with shave soaps due to its porous features. Cool right? Its water absorption allows it to create a richer lather for your shave. Where this rich lather is coming from? No shave kit is complete without a shave soap. We took a lot of time determining what should go into our shave soap. Our beautiful mugs are priceless! So we decided to go with organic ingredients that promote great, healthy looking skin and a nice shave. What's not to love? This kit includes the Hawk Razor, the Game Changer (Organic Shave Soap), the Instigatuh (Badger Hair brush), 5 premium blades, and a stand for your new razor. Did we mention this makes an incredible gift for him? Women have also raved about using our razors and so buy yours today! Don't be left in the past. We are also big advocates of giving back to our community. Every month 5% of net profits will go to an organization of our choice displayed on our website. Be a part of the cause!

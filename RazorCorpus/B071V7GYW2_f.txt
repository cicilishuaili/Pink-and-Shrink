Personna Women's 5-Blade Disposable Razors are a premium five blade women's disposable razor with a comfort coated cartridge designed to glide over your skin. The coating is infused with botanical oils, aloe, and vitamin E to protect the skin from chafing, dryness, and irritation. The result is smooth, touchable skin. Comfort Coated® blades offer the smoothest shave, and the 5-blade system captures and cuts hair below the skins surface for a truly close shave. The rounded cartridge design and ergonomic handle allow you to shave every curve comfortably. The Moisture Halo® contains plant-derived botanical oils that help to nourish the skin. Personna brand razor blades are made in the USA from imported steel. These disposable razors are made from the same razor blades that we use on our system razors, resulting in the same quality shave. You won't be giving up a great shave to save a few dollars. They certainly aren't cheap razor quality. These disposables are perfect for taking to the gym or as a traveling razor.

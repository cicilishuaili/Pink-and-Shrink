Safety razor made a comeback. Our first class design features outstanding craftsmanship engineered for maximum comfort and closeness. Offering our customers a platinum grade experience as well as value for money is vitally important to us. We also include a deluxe stand for convenient drying and storage. We created Dapper Mark with a comfortable grip and it is weighted so that you can easily shave on the proper cutting angle. Remember to allow the weight to do the majority of the work and do not apply too much pressure. This vintage style caters to most hair types, as well as being gentle on skin that is susceptible to irritation.

ZEEPK SHAVETTE MENS SHAVING GIFT SET WITH BLADES REPLACEMENTS Many people love the idea of "cut-throat" straight razor, but they don't love the honing and maintaince needed to keep it in that way. The shavette razor allows you the best of both worlds. You can get the closeness and feedback that you get with a long, sharp blade, but you don't have the maintenance when you can simply switch out the blades with a new, fresh edge. Also, great for barbers who need a new, sanitary blade with each client. How to load the Razor into the holder Step 1: Lift the metal catch at the end of your Zeepk Razor Step 2: Separate the two metal sections of the razor. Step 3: Keep the Blade in its wrap, and break in half the blade like shown in the picture. Step 4: Fit the blade over the two raised bumps on the lower metal section. Step 5: Then place the higher metal section on top and squeeze together. Step6: Close the catch over the two metal sections. Your straight razor is now ready for use. Prepare to enjoy your closest and most satisfying shave yet. How to shave with a Shavette Preparation is very important. Your beard and skin must be softened and ready. Use hot towel for 30 seconds to open up your skin pores. Then work the shaving soap up to a rich latherand apply with your Zeva Shaving brush, using a circular motion to make the hairs stand up ready for shaving. Stretching the skin with your free hand, use the other to move the Shavette in short strokes in the direction that the hair grows.Hold the Shavette at a 30degree angle to the skin - that way it cuts the whiskers and avoids cutting you! After you are done shaving apply cold water to close your skin pores.

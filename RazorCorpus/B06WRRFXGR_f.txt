Priceless." - Huffington Post   ---   The Sphynx Portable Razor is a new, innovative gadget designed to let you shave on the go, perfect for missed spots and quick touch-ups no matter where life takes you. Each colorful, compact razor contains:   (1) one refillable water spray bottle,  (1) one moisturizing pre-shave bar, and  (2) two razor blades.   Unlike traditional razors, the Sphynx Razor is designed to be truly portable and easy to use on-the-go:   Comes with a refillable water spray bottle so you never have to search for a sink or bathroom when you need a quick touch up The pre-shave bar is resistant to high temperatures, so you can travel with it to warm, sunny destinations. And because the pre-shave bar is packed with Shea Butter, Coconut Oil and Cocoa Butter, it doubles as a moisturizer and can be rubbed into your skin when done shaving to soften and nourish your skin.  Includes two individual razor blades so you always have a back-up for emergencies The blades and pre-shave bar are replaceable with the Sphynx Refill Pack   The Sphynx Razor is not meant to replace your at-home blades or shaving routine.

This is VERSION 2 model: V2 update: We have updated the Hawk to a version 2 model. The shave geometry has NOT changed, so it will shave the same as our original Hawk, but we have made some noticeable improvements to the look, feel and blade loading of the razor. We hope you enjoy and appreciate them! Here are the V2 changes: The top cap has been rounded for a more organic and natural feel on your face. Shavers coming over to the SE world who previously only have DE experience will find the transition much more intuitive. We have changed the blade guide posts to pins. The pins allow easier and better loading of the blades, especially the guarded style blades. We have strengthened the safety bar on the base plate with a new three slot design. This will help prevent the leading edge from being dented if knocked around or if the razor experiences a small drop. We have updated the handle to our Halo ring design for increased comfort and feel. The handle also now includes a butt end which can be unscrewed to allow for a shorter format. In the future, we may sell different style butt ends, possibly in different materials, to allow for some small customization. Please make sure to drop us an email with your feedback on the new handle.

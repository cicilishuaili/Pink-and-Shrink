Schick Intuition Plus Soothing Moisture is the first and only razor system that lathers and shaves in one easy step, leaving your skin smooth and noticeably softer. These soothing moisture cartridges are formulated with milk and honey. A pivoting head with four blades provides greater flexibility and allows you to follow the natural curves of your legs and body. For a closer, faster shave that results in hydrated skin, the skin moisturizing solid surrounding the razor eliminates the need for shave gel, soap, or body wash.

Milk and Honey Formula for Smooth, Hydrated Skin
Schick Intuition Plus Soothing Moisture cartridges offer a clean shave with hydrating ingredients, including milk and honey. Ideal for daily use, the soothing moisture formula restores you body's moisture levels and keeps your skin feeling smooth and supple. When you start shaving, the skin moisturizing solid reacts with water and melts just enough to create a light foam. Intuition Plus razors allow you to lather and shave in one easy step. Without the need for a separate shave gel, soap, or body wash, you'll save time while simultaneously hydrating your skin.

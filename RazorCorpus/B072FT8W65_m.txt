BIC Flex 5 is the only 5-blade disposable razor with a balancing sphere for better shave control. Five flexible blades individually adjust to the contours of the skin delivering an ultra-close shave. The razor's head pivots 40 degree enhancing shave control even more. A precision edging blade is also included in order to reach those tricky spots like under the nose or the side burns.

Giraffe Bath & Body designed The Giraffe specifically to assist women who were unable to shave their legs due to limitations in flexibility and mobility. These limitations could stem from the increasing discomfort from symptoms associated with the second and third trimester of pregnancy, sports injuries, hip and knee surgery or a chronic medical condition such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, muscular dystrophy, and shoulder, neck or back pain. All of these conditions decrease flexibility and mobility and therefore, make shaving difficult if not impossible with a short-handled razor. And as a result, some women just “give up” on shaving their legs entirely or resort to a caregiver or loved one to carry out this personal daily care routine. Our solution to help address this problem resulted in the invention of the Patented Giraffe Razor Extension Handle, a personal grooming assistant that customizes the length and angle of your premium disposable or reusable razor handle. The telescoping handle adds 15-20 inches in length, and the articulating head rotates to a 30°, 45° or 90°-degree angle maximizing your reach, therefore, eliminating bending at the waist and overextending yourself while shaving your legs. These features also decrease the risk of falling when shaving in the shower by helping you to keep both feet firmly on the ground and putting an end to the balancing act on one foot, also known as “shower yoga”! To help improve the functionality of The Giraffe, we designed an Ergonomic Handle, that has Easy to Use Quick Connect and Release Buttons as well as a Wrist Lanyard for Easy Retrieval. For your convenience, The Giraffe's Universal Razor Adapters accommodate the most popular men’s and women’s disposable and reusable razors on the market today which means you may already have a razor that you are using which is compatible with The Giraffe.

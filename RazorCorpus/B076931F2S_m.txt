The EZ BLADE double edged razors are premium and built to last for a whole shave. We really took our time choosing the right double edge razor. We originally started as barbers in the barbering industry. So we knew what type of blade to choose. We wanted something sharp. Our Blades are made from Swedish steel. Sweden is home to the purest iron ore which results in the strongest steel meaning less imperfections and longer lasting blades.

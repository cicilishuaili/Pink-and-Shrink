Each cartridge features 5 razor blades with precision-honed edges that are both durable and sharp, a flex hinge that contours to your face, a lubricating strip for a smooth finish, and a precision trimmer for those hard-to-reach places. The handle is designed with a texturized grip pattern, rubberized matte exterior, and a weighted core for maximum control and grip.

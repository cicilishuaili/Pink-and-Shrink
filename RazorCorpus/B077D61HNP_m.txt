This black straight razor kit looks unique and its unordinary packing box makes it a perfect gift for men.  Shave-Ready Blade Every razor is honed by professional grinders before it goes out of the factory. Only manual honing will get the blade sharp enough and not harm the blade edge.  Stropping Leather The supplied stropping leather is made of leather and canvas. Rub the razor on the leather strop before every use and you will keep the blade edge sharp for a longer time.  Black Matte Surface The stainless steel blade is plated with black matte coat. This coat will not chip or fall off, it addes the razor an elegant look and prevents the blade against scratches.  Notice: Hone the blade with whetstone when it is not sharp any more, the strop can only help to prolong the service time but not to hone the blade.

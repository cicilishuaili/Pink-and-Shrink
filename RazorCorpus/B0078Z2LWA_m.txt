These razor blades are designed for a perfect fit every time - they ensure that the exact and precise blade exposure is achieved when these blades are used in straight edge barber razors or "shavette" type razors. These stainless steel blades are extremely sharp and durable. They are PTFE (a.k.a. Teflon) coated to ensure a smooth shave and a long-lasting blade. (Do not wipe these blades dry after use as doing so will remove the PTFE coating.) The Perma-Sharp Half Blades have quickly become a favorite of our Barbershops! You will wonder why you never used them before, especially if you have been splitting double edge blades. Each box comes with 100 individually wrapped Perma-Sharp 1/2 blades. These are universally renowned for being long lasting, exceptionally smooth and very sharp. If you use a straight edge razor that accepts half a double edge blade, this professional product is for you. There is no finer blade manufactured for straight edge razors/shavers.

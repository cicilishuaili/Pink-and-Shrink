The category-breakthrough waterless by Gillette Venus shaving system requires no water to use, making it a truly portable product that allows on-demand use when and where itâ€™s needed. The all-in-one design features a soft handle filled with a lubricating gel that the user squeezes through the application sponge. The lubricating gel, which contains aloe, was developed to provide a smooth and waterless shave without the need to rinse and leaves no residue or stickiness.

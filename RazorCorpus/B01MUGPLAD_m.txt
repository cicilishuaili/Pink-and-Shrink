Why Choose The MCS Journeyman Double Edge Safety Razor? Sometimes, the old way is better. Traditional shaving is making a comeback with men who want to free themselves from over-priced multi-bladed monstrosities, or a closer, irritation free shave experience.   Transitioning from cartridge razors has never been easier than it is today. Sure, there's a learning curve, you may nick yourself a few times, but it won't hurt or scar. You can shave for a YEAR with our Double Edge Razor for the price of one package of multi-blade cartridges! Keep your hard earned dollar in your wallet. A cartridge costs about $3.50. It's good for 3-4 shaves, but because It's pricey, men often keep using it beyond it's prime.  Safety Razor Blades cost less than 20 cents each, and easily last 3-6 shaves, depending on your beard.  Wet Shaving prevents ingrown hairs & razor burn. Cartridges lift the hair, and then cut it. Because hair is elastic it contracts below the skin causing ingrown hairs as it grows. Safety Razors cut the hair even with the skin, minimizing the risk of ingrown hairs and irritation.  Mild/Medium Aggressiveness Aggressiveness is based on how far the blade is from the guard. An aggressive razor has is wider, and a mild razor has a narrow gap. This determines how much of the hair (or skin) will be exposed to the blade when shaving. If your razor is too aggressive you'll get nicks and cuts. If it's is too mild you'll have to shave the same area over and over to get a close shave, causing razor burn. Our Journeyman Razor is the best of both worlds. It has a mild to medium aggressiveness. You'll get a close shave, but you won't want to run out and buy a more aggressive razor as soon as you get the basic technique down. Other razors, often sold to men who want to be vikings, have such a mild blade exposure that they'll barely cut more than stubble.

Overall Length: 9.50 INCHES APPROX Blade Length: 3.0 INCHES APPROX Closed: 6.5 Inches Pattern: Twisted Damascus Layers: 200+ Handle: Pakka wood. Leather Sheath The razor blade was handmade out of tempered, high-carbon, stainless steel. It exhibits high hardness, good toughness, and an excellent edge holding capability. The blade has been hand ground to a fine edge with a thin blade cross-section, and is very sharp. A hair will easily catch on the blade, and it will readily pass the common sharpness test of cleanly slicing newspaper. Damascus steel is forge welded using alternating layers of two materials, high-carbon steel, and low carbon iron. The surface is first polished and then acid etched to reveal a variety of patterns.

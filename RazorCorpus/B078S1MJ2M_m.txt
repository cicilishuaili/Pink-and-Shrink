The finest blades make the finest straight razors and the Kingsland Shaving Co. offers some of the finest blades around. The affordable price, superior handmade craftsmanship, and hand sharpened shave ready blade make this a great option for straight razor shavers of all types and experience levels. Don't let the price fool you - with the Carbon Steel blade and wooden scales, the razor is built to last! The fitted tin case and drawstring pouch provide protection, storage, and make it a great gift set for those looking for an authentic cut throat razor. Of all the shaving implements ever used, none were as finely crafted as the straight razor. Around the turn of the century, when life picked up a faster pace, men abandoned their straight razors and devised faster ways to shave. Though new shaving implements saved time, something was lost - particularly the oddly serene morning ritual of balancing life and death on the edge of a razor blade. If you're looking to embrace a meditative practice that provides a superior shave, consider learning how to shave with a straight razor. Among other reasons, using a straight razor can seriously cut down on waste. No longer will you need to buy packages of cartridge razors and cast them into the garbage after a few uses.

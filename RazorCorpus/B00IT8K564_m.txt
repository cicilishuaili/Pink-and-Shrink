   The first-of-its-kind complete shaving system designed to help reduce and prevent irritation and razor bumps. The Bevel Shave System Starter Kit is a 5-part system that includes the Bevel Razor and Blades, Bevel Badger Brush and a supply of Bevel Priming Oil (1 oz), Bevel Shave Cream (2 oz) and Bevel Restoring Balm (2 oz).  Begin your shave by preparing your skin with the Bevel Priming Oil then apply your Bevel Shave Cream with the Bevel Badger brush to create a rich, moisturizing lather. Soothe and refine your skin after your shave with the no-sting, hydrating Bevel Restoring Balm. Use a fresh Bevel Blade in your Bevel Razor each time you shave for a close, clean Bevel Shave.  The Bevel Shave System was clinically tested to help reduce and prevent razor bumps and irritation in four weeks.

The Truth Big Razor Blade Companies Don't Want You to Know Razor blades get dull and need to be replaced. Big advertising tells us more the blades better the razors and we should pay for the Shave Tech. The truth is, the best shave a man (or a woman) can get is using a classic single blade razor or a straight razor. Benefits of Our Classic Single Blade Razor Also known as a Safety Razor, our Razor uses a single double edge blade. The blade mounts inside the top mount which features a smooth shaving edge to protect your skin. The final result is a gentle classic shave every man deserves. Why Our Safety Razor Stands Out From the Crowd? Quality is our obsession. Our safety razor features a heavyweight handle constructed of the most rugged material we could find. The razor will never rust. This is a shaving razor you use for life. > You will get an awesome shave whether you have a rough beard or sensitive skin. NOTE: We provide blades that are more geared toward milder shave. If you prefer a more aggressive blade, please use a blade of your choice. Any blade you use, Bigfoot Shaves is the razor for you.

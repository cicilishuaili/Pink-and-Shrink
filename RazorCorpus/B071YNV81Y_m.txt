The Persona Caliber 3Â® Disposable is a premium 3 blade men's disposable razor with double coated blades that provides a close and smooth shave. This razor has an ergonomically designed handle with rubber which provides a better grip and less slip. The pivoting head adjusts to the contours of your skin. Our Virtual Guard design element ensures a safe shave. The ceramic coated blades offer a smooth and comfortable shaving experience. The blade also has an optimized soap bar profile that was specifically designed to improve the flow of the razor on the skin, eliminate friction, and balance the cartridge. The result is a truly luxurious shave. These razors are made from the same high-quality razor blades we use in our system razors. Not a cheap razor, just a great value. These are a great razor to pack in your gym bag or take with you when you travel. Personna is a trusted brand. We were founded in 1875.

Headblade's most advanced razor cartridge has all the features of the HB4 yet has two more blades. Over three years were spent creating a unique pivot that lets the HB6 blade cartridge be used on any HeadBlade, including the original HeadBlade Classic, thanks to the supplied adapter that comes in each blade kit. Kit contains one adapter and four blades.

Parker's PTB straight edge barber/shavette razor is designed for personal or professional use in a barbershop. This razor has a stainless steel insert for easy blade loading and removal. This razor will hold either professional model blades or half of a double edge blade. We believe this razor is of unparalleled value and quality. Also included are 5 Shark Super Stainless barber blades, the first choice of many of our barbershop clientele -- these provide a much more precise and accurate fit than half cutting or breaking a double edge blade

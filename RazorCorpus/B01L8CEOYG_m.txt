Tips: Don't rinse your skin with hot water after shaving. That makes the skin expand again, and that's when hair will get sucked back behind the swollen skin, causing ingrown hairs. We recommend rinsing your skin with cold water to make it contract.  Storage: Pls clean it with water after use,and let it dry,keep it away from the child because of the sharp blades.

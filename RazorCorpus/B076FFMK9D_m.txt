WET OR DRY SHAVE Use your Selfieshaver in the shower or in front of the mirror. Either way, you'll get a clean, close shave without the irritation of razor burn. Just change out you razor every couple of shaves with a new blade and you'll be good to go. GREAT FOR TRAVEL This practical addition to your grooming kit folds up and fits into its own carry bag so you can throw it in with the rest of your men's grooming tools and go. Only 11 ounces! EASY TO USE 1) Extend the shaver over your shoulder or around the side of your back.  2) Next, use an up and down motion to remove hair. For the areas that are harder for you to reach, use your Selfieshaver across your back in small strokes.  3) Make sure that you shower or soak your back before shaving in order to prevent razor bumps. The warm water will remove dirt and bacteria as well as soften up the hair for easy removal.

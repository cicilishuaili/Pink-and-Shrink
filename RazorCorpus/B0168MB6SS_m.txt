Gillette Fusion5 ProShield Chill men’s blade refill, with lubrication before & after the blades, shields from irritation and cools while you shave. Cooling technology offers a refreshing sensation during the shave. It also features 5 precision blades for incredible comfort (vs. Mach3). With Gillette’s thinnest and finest blades (first 4 blades, vs. Fusion5), ProShield Chill allows less tug & pull (vs. Fusion5). The Precision Trimmer on the back is great for hard-to-reach areas such as under the nose and sideburns. One razor blade refill equals up to one month of shaves. Fusion5 ProShield Chill blade refills fit all Fusion5 & Fusion5 Power razors.

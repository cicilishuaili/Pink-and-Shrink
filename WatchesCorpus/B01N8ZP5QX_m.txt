​THE ORIGINAL SWISS SPORT WATCH ALPINE SPORTS WATCH MANUFACTURING SINCE 1883 Alpina, famous for its red triangle signature, is an independent, family-owned fine watchmaking manufacture based in Geneva, Switzerland. Founded in 1883, Alpina’s watchmaking history spans more than 130 years. A true pioneer of the Swiss watchmaking industry, Alpina has been the source of numerous innovations, patents and calibers. Alpina invented the concept of the sport watch, as we know it today, with the birth of its legendary Alpina 4 in 1938. Faithful to its long tradition of creating mechanical calibers, Alpina produces five in-house movements in its Manufacture: the Tourbillon AL-980, the World Timer AL-718, the Automatic Regulator AL-950, the Small Date Automatic AL-710, and most recently the AL-760 In House Manufacture Direct Flyback Chronograph, a robust movement with only 96 components.

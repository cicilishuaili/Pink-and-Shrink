The Hagen Connected hybrid smartwatch combines innovative technology with classic design. Features include automatic time and date adjustment, activity and goal tracking, filtered email and text notifications, dual-time function, alarm and SKAGEN Link technology, which allows the wearer to snap a photo, control their music and more-all with the push of a button. Hagen Connected is compatible with iOS and Android and syncs wirelessly to the SKAGEN app, where you can view your data and manage settings. The watch runs on a standard coin-cell battery with a four- to six-month battery life, so it never needs to be recharged. And the quick-release-pin construction makes it easy to interchange the steel-mesh bracelet wtih the 20mm leather band, other steel-mesh bracelets or silicone straps.

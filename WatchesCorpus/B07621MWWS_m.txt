From G-SHOCK, the watch that always strives for toughness, the first G-STEEL lineup models to offer chronograph performance in analog format. Though all the dials of this model are analog, they still boast G-Shock level shock resistant. The dial at 9 o'clock has a multi-functional rotating disk cut to resemble the thick blades of a jet engine that feature a change of color within the rotation of the blades to indicate the battery level and alarm setting. In addition, the blade rotates in the timekeeping and stopwatch mode with the passage of time. For a better fit to the wrist and elegant design, a new layer guard structure houses resin that cushions parts inside the case and a higher density mounting. Equipped with Bluetooth&#153, these watches can connect to a smartphone with the press of a button and acquire time information from an internet time server with the result of accurate timekeeping no matter where in the world that you are.

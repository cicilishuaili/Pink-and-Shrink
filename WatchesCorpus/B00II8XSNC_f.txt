Generic black polyurethane watch band with stainless steel barrel inserts and a buckle clasp to ensures secure placement on your wrist. Strap has eight adjustment holes. This replacement band will fit the Invicta 1088 and 1843 Russian Diver skeleton watch. This is a single pin strap.   THE BAND YOU ARE CONSIDERING IS GUARANTEED TO FIT MODELS 1088 AND 1843. THERE ARE MANY REVIEWS CLAIMING THE BAND DOES NOT FIT BUT THEY ARE ALL DIFFERENT INVICTA MODELS. THIS BAND MAY FIT OTHER MODELS AND YOU MAY TRY IT, BUT PLEASE DO NOT FAULT US IF IT DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY ON OTHER INVICTA MODELS. WE DO NOT STATE ANYWHERE THAT THEY WILL FIT OTHER MODELS OTHER THAN 1088 AND 1843.   This aftermarket band only has one set of holes for the spring card pins, not two like the original band.

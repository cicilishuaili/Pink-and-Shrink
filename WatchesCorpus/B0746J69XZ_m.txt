Wind an watch by rotating the crown until the power source jumps start, and then it will work. Wear your watch, rotate the crown slowly. After about 25-30 times, when you feel resistance, stop rotating. Don't over-wind as the spring would be damaged ultimately. Package Included: 1* Pocket Watch 1* Gift Box 1* Chain

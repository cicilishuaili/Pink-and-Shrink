Our Xalvador line of Pocket watches under our private brand "ShoppeWatch" make superb birthday or Christmas gifts, in addition to great wedding and groomsmen gifts. They are also ideal for corporate gifts or for the retirement of a long time employee. Here is an example of an Irish motif Claddagh pocket watch in a vintage design for anyone that wants the classic look and practicality of a quality quartz movement pocket watch. Great piece for a first communion gift.

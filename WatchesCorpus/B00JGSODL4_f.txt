Cogito Classic brings together the power of a connected Watch with the sophistication of a precision-crafted timepiece. Designed for the busy, social and fashionable crowd, COGITO merges Classic analog movement with a Lucid digital display. When linked with the smartphone or tablet app, COGITO allows users to cut through the digital noise by customizing Settings based on their priorities and selecting which notifications will appear. On the Watch face, users can see who is calling or messaging, and decide whether to answer or mute it. Cogito frees users from continually checking their phones. Optimized for iOS 7 and Android 4.0 devices.

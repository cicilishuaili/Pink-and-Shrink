Emporio Armani makes its introduction into wearables with the Emporio Armani Connected hybrid smartwatch. With the dynamic styling of Emporio Armani design and the benefits of today's wearable technology, the hybrid smartwatch is compatible with both Apple and Android smartphones. Wirelessly syncing to your mobile device, this timepiece is always accurate, and automatically converts time zone and date as you travel. The Emporio Armani Connected hybrid smartwatch also automatically tracks and monitors sleep and activity, allows you to set up subtle filtered notifications, and connects to your smartphone's music to start, stop, skip, or go back with the simple press of a button. Its coin cell battery also means the watch never needs charging. This hybrid smartwatch features a black textured dial with silver-tone indexes and is complemented by a black IP case and three-link bracelet. The watch's subdial displays the date and tracks your goal throughout the day.

Add high-tech style with signature Diesel flair to any look with the DieselOn Time hybrid smartwatch. A gold-tone case is paired with a black leather padded strap and a black sunray dial with applied brushed gold-tone arabics and white printed tracking. Track your activity using the sub-disc on the dial, so you'll know the second you've reached goal and you can reward yourself later. The sleep tracker will help you recount your light, restful and awake time. Receive alerts on your watch so you never miss a call from your boss (or so you DO miss calls from your ex). Use the link function to play or pause music, hit next/previous track, snag a photo or ring your phone.

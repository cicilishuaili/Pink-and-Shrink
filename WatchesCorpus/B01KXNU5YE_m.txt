MAKING THE LITTLE STUFF BETTER. We make the little things better. The stuff you have that isn't noticed first, but can't be ignored. We pay attention to it. We argue about it. We work day and night to make the little things as good as it can be, so when you wear it, you feel like you've got a leg up on the rest of the world. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.Nixon’s Supplier Code of Conduct ensures all of our suppliers are adhering to socially responsible business practices, meaning all products are produced under lawful, humane, and ethical conditions. ACCESSORIES THAT REFLECT WHO WE ARE & THE LIFE WE LIVE. Fueled by adventures far and wide, and sometimes by those that happen just down the street, we deliver products that meet your needs. We travel the globe to experience life; the journey to get there takes shape in the things we create. EXPRESS YOURSELF.  When you wear a watch, you deserve to have something that reflects your entire package. You may not know how to say it, but you’ve got something to say and we’re here to provide that voice.

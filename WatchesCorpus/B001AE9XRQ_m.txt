The exquisite Seiko SARB033 is powered by the premium Seiko 6R15 caliber self-winding movement that can also be hand wound and hacked. It is the same caliber that powers most of the Seiko Prospex line of watches. The movement has a generous 50 hour power reserve. The case has a fine brushed finish and the black dial sports luminous hands and silvertone hour markers. A date display is shown at the 3 o'clock position. The stainless steel bracelet has a deployant clasp with a dual push-button release. A scratch resistant sapphire crystal is used along with an exhibition back that allows you to view the movement in action. Water resistant 100 meters. This is definitely a luxury range watch that is available at an affordable price. An excellent timepiece for sure.

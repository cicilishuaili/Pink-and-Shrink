Cool tones, durable components, and urban styling make up the Women's Baby-G White Analog Sport Watch from reliable designer Casio. Backgrounded by a silver-tone case and encircled with a thick, white bezel with protective tabs, the creamy, white dial features silver-tone Arabic numbers marking the hours, luminous hands, and three convenient sub-dials. With the capacity for 29 time zones, five alarms, stopwatch, countdown timer, and 12- and 24-hour formats, this sleek watch also features month, date, and day displays. An LED light makes it easy to read the time night or day, and this modern timepiece is water resistant to 330 feet (100 meters). Add Casio's flagship shock resistant technology, and you have a super-dependable and snazzy watch that wraps comfortably around the wrist with a white resin band and buckle clasp.

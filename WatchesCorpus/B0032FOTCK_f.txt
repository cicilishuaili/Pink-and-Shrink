Simple and classic, yet featuring precision-quality movement, the Citizen Women's Eco Drive Two-Tone Watch offers minimalist style and high functionality for everyday wear. The craftsmanship shines through in the stainless steel case and bezel while the stainless steel bracelet features gold-toned accents for a traditional look. The clean, white dial displays everything you need--slender, gold-toned hour and minute hands along with black, easy-to-read Arabic numeral indexes, and a discreet calendar display. For added durability, the mineral crystal is scratch resistant. Plus, this  watch is powered by Japanese quartz movement and fueled by natural and artificial light so it doesn't require a battery. With a 180-day power reserve when fully charged, the Citizen Women's Eco Drive Two-Tone Watch is also water resistant to 330 feet (100 meters).

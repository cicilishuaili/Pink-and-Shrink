Why amBand?We have personally selected the high-quality materials to create the bands. We always work hard to ensure high quality standards through 3 times quality checks. You are our top priority and we strive to make you happy.Top quality material: The band is consists of 52 pieces of premium 316L stainless steel which are polished by a number of processes and colored by vacuum plating. Hence it is more wear and corrosion-resisting, and will never get rusty.Safe and comfortable: This watch band is designed with folding clasp, which having a two button press to unlock also stops accidental bumps knocking it of and can be firmly wore and easy to take off.Compared to rubber strap, stainless steel watch strap has better breathability and prevents you from allergy. It feels nice on the skin, never cause your hand to sweat.Compatible with any watch (traditional or smart watch) that uses standard 18mm, 20mm or 22mm spring bars.To determine proper width for your watch, measure the width where current band attaches to the watch head.A few common compatible smart watch widths:18 mm width:- ASUS Zen Watch 2 1.45";- HUAWEI Watch;- WITHINGS Activite POP/Steel/Sapphire;- Fossil Q Tailor;20 mm width:- Moto 360 2nd Gen Men's 42mm;- Withings Steel HR 40mm;- PEBBLE Time Round Large 20 mm;- SAMSUNG Gear S2 Classic;- TICHWATCH 2;- Fossil Q Founder 2.0;22 mm width:- Moto 360 2nd Gen Men's 46mm;;- ASUS Zen Watch 1- ASUS Zen Watch 2 1.63";- LG Urban, LG G Watch, and LG R Watch;- PEBBLE watch, PEBBLE 2 watch- PEBBLE Time and PEBBLE Time Steel;- SAMSUNG Gear S3 Classic;- SAMSUNG Gear S3 Frontier;- Huawei Watch 2 Classic;- VECTOR Luna watch;- Fossil Q Wander;- Fossil Q Wander;- Fossil Q Crewmaster;- Fossil Q Nate

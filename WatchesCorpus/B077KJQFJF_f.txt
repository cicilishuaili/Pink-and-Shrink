Expand your Gelfand & Co. watch band collection with our genuine leather straps, premium mesh bands and army tough NATO nylon bands. Featuring spring loaded quick release tabs, installation and removal is simple, easy and requires no tools. Watch buckles are available in silver, rose gold and black. Although these watch bands were fabricated for Gelfand & Co. watches in the Hampton and Prestige collections, they are universal to all watches that have 18mm spring bars. Please read below about our brand and watches. Gelfand & Co. watches were built on two core principles: • Your lifestyle deserves a watch that suits it - regardless of who you are and what you do, you will find a Gelfand & Co. watch that will easily match your personality to a tee. • Expensive does not count for good - our innovative production processes allow us to keep our prices down. A Gelfand & Co. watch is affordable, but never confuse that with cheap. Gelfand & Co. watches are inspired by thousands of ordinary people doing thousands of ordinary (and extraordinary) things. When we started this journey we looked at what other watch companies were doing. Some were designing statements people paid for through the nose. Others were happy just stiffing consumers with flimsy products that are ridiculously overpriced. There was no middle ground, until Gelfand & Co. We promise to offer exceptional quality. Each one of our watches is crafted with a premium 316L stainless steel crown and casing, Japan movement technology and sapphire coated mineral glass to resist scratches. We deliver perfect workmanship to the dial and metal hour indexes. All of our watches use high quality IP plating, passing all wear and sweat resisting tests. Time is your luxury with a Gelfand & Co. timepiece on your wrist.

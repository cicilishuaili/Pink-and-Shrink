This is a smart watch? All the easy-to-use, time-saving features that Pebble pioneered to define the smart watch category, now available in a design that’s lighter and thinner than any other smart watch. Its battery lasts for days - not hours - and its bright e-paper display is always on. Check notifications, incoming calls, texts, and your calendar, all at a glance. Includes Pebble Health, a built-in activity and sleep tracker with daily reports and weekly insights. Behind all those smarts, it’s still a great watch. It just also happens to look like one.

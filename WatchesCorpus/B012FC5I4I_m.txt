The new G-SHOCK GWG-1000, dubbed the "MUD MASTER," is constructed to resist mud and vibration so that it can be useful in a variety of harsh land environments. Over the years, G-SHOCK watches have added many innovative construction and design features to their outstanding shock resistance. Notably, the G-SHOCK GW-A1100,*1 designed to meet the needs of free-flying pilots, and the G-SHOCK GWN-1000,*2 useful for performing missions in rough seas, have been very well received as analog watches that offer the ultimate in toughness. *1 Features Triple G Resist reinforced construction to resist shocks, centrifugal force and vibrations *2 Equipped with a Triple Sensor for determining compass bearing, atmospheric pressure/altitude, and temperature. The new G-SHOCK GWG-1000 was designed for deserts, mud, and other tough environments, and it is packed with features that deliver the toughness needed for use in harsh land environments. In addition to offering shock resistance, the watch is constructed for mud resistance and is ready to withstand working amid mud and rubble. The buttons are protected against the entry of mud, to ensure that essential functions are available at all times. The watch offers vibration resistance to withstand vibration from rough road drive or other heavy duty operations. These features give the watch toughness that the user can depend on in various challenging situations. The new watch has a compass bearing readout to help users pinpoint the right direction and a barometer which is useful for predicting changes in weather. These readings enable the wearer to quickly assess natural conditions. The watch design features large hour and minute hands with large index marks and a front button, expressing the toughness of G-SHOCK watches while offering practical readability and enhanced operability. From construction through features and design, the G-SHOCK GWG-1000 is in every way designed to withstand harsh environments.

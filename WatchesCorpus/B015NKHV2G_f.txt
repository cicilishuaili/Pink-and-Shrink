BARTON's Ballistic Nylon NATO Style watch bands are custom designed and fabricated to meet the highest standard of fashion, function and fit... and we back it up with a full satisfaction guarantee. Buy multiple bands to compliment your wardrobe and swap in seconds. Selecting Width:  Straps are available in 18mm, 20mm, 22mm and 24mm widths. To determine the proper width for your watch, use a metric ruler to measure the 'lug width' (the point on the watch head where the band attaches). Lug widths for most common watches are also available from the manufacturer online.  Selecting and Adjusting Length:  All widths (18mm, 20mm or 22mm) of our original 'Standard' length band measure approximately 10-inches in total length and fit wrists from 5" to 7 1/2" in circumference. All widths (20mm, 22mm and 24mm) of our 'Long' version measure 11-inches in total length and fit wrists from 6" to 8 1/2". However, watch size and geometry also impacts fit. Those with larger wrists (above 7 1/4") typically prefer the 'long' version. If band is longer than desired, fold free end neatly back into the keeper loop or cut to desired length. If trimmed, expose cut end to match or lighter flame to avoid fraying. Full money back guarantee for anyone that does encounter a fit issue.  Attaching the Band:   Refer to diagram in picture above. First, remove original band and reinsert spring bars into watch head (replacement spring bars sold separately on Amazon if needed). Then, simply feed strap between the spring bar and watch casing, behind watch head and up through the other spring bar. Run through stainless steel ring on short strap to secure watch head. No need to remove spring bars (pins) to swap between different colors.

Natural Glass=Natural Vision By absorbing 85% of visible light and blocking out most of the blue light, the Natural Glass lenses ensure better clarity of vision and remarkable color contrast, providing a more 'natural vision'. Consumers will also like the fact that they are more exceptional scratch resistance than comparable plastics.  HD Polarized=Live Glare Free A headache from glare can ruin your day.

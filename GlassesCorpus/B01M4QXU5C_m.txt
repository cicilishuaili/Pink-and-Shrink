Tired of those old plastic sunglasses that feel cheap, clunky and heavy? Our designers at Viable Harvest have created the perfect lightweight wooden sunglasses just for you! Our sunglasses are hand crafted with organic red sandalwood for a unique design that looks and feels great. With sleek lines and a leisurely style, the Viable Harvest sunglasses are ideal for the backyard or your next great adventure. We love the red sandalwood not only for its strength but for its amazing look - an exciting and unique grain and color pattern that boasts nothing but style. They've been lightly polished to enhance their natural wooden tones and provide a stunningly smooth finish. We use premium, high quality, certified polarized lenses with a UV400 rating. We're not only concerned with how you look, but how we can help protect you for life.The classic wayfarer style is anything but boring. A universal fit and unisex design make this a great choice for our regular customers or for those trying Viable Harvest for the first time. We make all of our products from natural, eco-friendly wood, and we're confident these will look and feel great next to your skin. Going casual? No problem! Dressing it up for a day out? We've got the look for you! We've also included a custom designed gift box with a soft, microfiber cleaning cloth.At Viable Harvest, we care about our customers.

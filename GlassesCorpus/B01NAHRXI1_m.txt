 Why you should use our Knight Visor driving glasses?   Driving at night can be a challenging task for new or even experienced drivers; the highest crash rates occur at nighttime. The major reasons for that are:   While at night our vision is more limited, headlight glares from oncoming traffic can further reduce your visual sensitivity and cause your eyes to become fatigued.  Many drivers don't have their headlights set up properly and/or the dust on their headlight lenses diffuses the light, producing a glare that can easily blind you for few seconds.

Gascan lenses are cut from the curve of a single lens shield, then mounted in the frame to maintain the original, continuous contour. The look is so unique, we customized our corporate logo just for this eyewear. The lightweight o matter frame material offers premium comfort while our three-point fit retains the lenses in precise optical alignment.
